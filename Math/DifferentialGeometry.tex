\chapter{Topological Considerations}

\section{Manifolds}

Topology attempts to describe the properties of space invariant under actions which stretch and squash continuously. Differential geometry extends this description to spatial properties constant when space is stretched and squashed, but not `bent' in some form. Four centuries of calculus have cemented these properties in the nice cartesian spaces $\mathbf{R}^n$. A basic environment to extend the notions of `bentness' should then be to consider spaces which are similar to $\mathbf{R}^n$. These are the topological manifolds:

\begin{definition}
    A {\bf manifold} is a Hausdorff space which is {\it locally euclidean}. In detail, every point $p$ on the manifold satisfies (1):
    %
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item[(1)] There exists a neighbourhood $U$ of $p$, and an integer $n \geq 0$ such that $U$ is homeomorphic to $\mathbf{R}^n$ (We take $\mathbf{R}^0 = \{0\}$).
    \end{enumerate}
    %
    A {\bf manifold with boundary} is a space also containing points that are {\it locally bounded}. Points in such a space must satisfy either (1) or (2):
    %
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item[(2)] The point $p$ in the manifold has a neighbourhood homeomorphic to a `halfspace' $\mathbf{H}^n = \{ (x_1, \dots, x_n) \in \mathbf{R}^n: x_1 \geq 0 \}$.
    \end{enumerate}
    %
    If $M$ is a manifold, the closed subset $\partial M$ is called the boundary of the manifold, and consists of all points satisfying (2), but not (1).
\end{definition}

The Hausdorff assumption is completely necessary to avoid controversy, for there are even spaces which are locally one-dimensional, yet not Hausdorff. Let $\mathbf{R}_0 = \mathbf{R} \times \{0\}$ and $\mathbf{R}_1 = \mathbf{R} \times \{1\}$ be two copies of the real line, and consider their disjoint union. Denote $(x,0)$ by $x_0$, and $(x,1)$ by $x_1$. Glue corresponding points $x_0$ and $x_1$ together, unless $x = 0$. The quotient space formed is not Hausdorff (try and separate $0_0$ and $0_1$). Nonetheless, all points in the space satisfy (1).

% Put picture of non-Hausdorff `manifold' here

\begin{example}
    $\mathbf{R}^n$ itself is a manifold. Any ball around a point $p$ in euclidean space is also a manifold; in these examples, we may simply take the entire space as the neighbourhood $U$ in (1).
\end{example}

From the above example, it is easy to see that any topological space homeomorphic to a manifold is also a manifold! In contrast to our introductory manifesto, which advocates differentiable invariance, the property of being a manifold is purely topological. Therefore, we cannot expect to gain any differentiable properties from a pure manifold. We will fix this problem in the next chapter.

\begin{example}[The Circle]
    Consider the set $S^1 = \{ x \in \mathbf{R}^2 : \|x\| = 1 \}$. The one-to-one continuous map $f: (0, \pi) \to S^1$ defined by
    %
    \[ x \mapsto e^{ix} = (\cos (x), \sin (x)) \]
    %
    maps onto the circle. The inverse $(x,y) \mapsto \cos^{-1}(x) = \sin^{-1}(y)$ is also continuous on the range considered, so $f$ is a homeomorphism onto its image. Taking the map on other intervals of length $\pi$, we obtain a set of homeomorphisms that cover the circle.
\end{example}

\begin{example}[$n$-Spheres]
    There is a less obvious map which permits an easy generalization to higher dimensional space. Consider $S^n - \{(1,0,\dots,0)\}$: we will project this shape onto the line $\{-1\} \times \mathbf{R}^{n-1}$ by taking the intersection of this line with the line that passes through $(1,0,\dots,0)$. Some calculation will show that this projection $f$ is defined by
    %
    \[ f(x_1, \dots, x_n) = \frac{2}{1 - x_1}(x_2, \dots, x_n) \]
    %
    And we may explicitly constructure the inverse function, again by a compuation, as
    %
    \begin{align*}
        f^{-1}(y_2, \dots, y_n) &= \left(1 - \frac{8}{4 + \sum_{k = 2}^n y_k^2}, \frac{4y_2}{4 + \sum_{k = 2}^n y_k^2}, \dots, \frac{4y_n}{4 + \sum_{k = 2}^n y_k^2} \right)\\
        &= \frac{1}{4 + \sum_{k = 2}^n y_k^2} \left( \sum_{k = 2}^n y_k^2 - 4, 4y_2, \dots, 4y_n \right)
    \end{align*}
%
An easy computation will verify that this truly is the inverse, and a brief glance at the formula that the inverse is continuous. If we project from $(-1,0,\dots,0)$ instead, then the homeomorphism $g$ is
%
\[ g(x_1, \dots, x_n) = \frac{1}{1 + x_1}(x_2, \dots, x_n) \]
%
\[ g^{-1}(y_2, \dots, y_n) = \frac{1}{4 + \sum_{k = 2}^n y_k^2} \left( 4 - \left(\sum_{k = 2}^n y_k^2 \right), 4y_2, \dots, 4y_n \right) \]
%
And we have covered $S^n$ with homeomorphisms -- the space is a manifold.
\end{example}

Any open subset of $\mathbf{R}^n$ is a manifold -- around any point, we may take $U$ to be an open ball contained in the subspace. A simple extension of this is that any open subset of a manifold, with the subspace topology, also satisfies the properties of being a manifold. Proofs of these kinds of statements rely on a certain trick. First, we conjure forth a homeomorphism to $\mathbf{R}^n$. Then we transport nice properties of $\mathbf{R}^n$ across the homeomorphism to the manifold itself. Here are some executions of this strategy.

\begin{theorem}
    Every manifold is locally compact.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
    Let $x$ be a point in an arbitrary manifold. Then there is an open neighbourhood $U$ of $x$ homeomorphic to $\mathbf{R}^n$ by a map $f:U \to \mathbf{R}^n$. Take any ball $B$ around $f(x)$, whose closure $\overline{B}$ is compact. Since compactness is purely topological, $f^{-1}(\overline{B})$ is a compact neighbourhood of $x$.
\end{proof}

The next problem requires more foresight on the reader, though the basic technique used is exactly the same.

\begin{theorem}
    Every manifold is locally path-connected. A connected manifold is path-connected.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
    We shall prove a stronger statement than was given in the theorem, since it reveals the power of local euclidean structure on a manifold. In fact, we will show that every manifold is locally arc-connected\footnote{An arc is a path that is not only continuous, but one-to-one as well.}, and a connected manifold is globally arc-connected.

    Local arc-connectedness should be obvious, and parts of an argument of this statement will be found in the following argument. Consider any connected manifold $M$, and let $x$ be an arbitrary point. Let $P$ be the set of all points in $M$ arcwise connected to $x$. Obviously, we must show that this set is open and closed, as done in any proof about connected spaces. Consider a point $y$ connected to $x$ by an arc $p:[0,1] \to M$ beginning at $x$. Take a neighbourhood $V$ of $y$, which does not contain $x$, and which is homeomorphic to the closed unit ball $\overline{B}$ around the origin. Since $\overline{B}$ is compact, $V$ is compact, hence it is closed. We may therefore consider the first number $z \in \mathbf{R}$ such that $p(z)$ lies in $V$. Then, taking an arc $p':[0,1] \to \overline{B}$ between $(f \circ p)(z)$ and any point in $\overline{B}$, and appending $f^{-1} \circ p'$ onto $p$ in the interval $[z,1]$, we obtain a new continuous path (by the pasting lemma), and this path is still an arc by construction.

    % Show Picture of Technique.

    We use the same trick to show $P$ is closed. Let $y$ be a limit point of $P$, and consider some neighbourhood $V$ of $y$ homeomorphic to the closed ball in $\mathbf{R}^n$. Then $V$ contains a point $z$ arcwise connected to $x$. Using the technique of the above paragraph, we may modify the arc from $x$ to $z$, and then extend it so it connects to $y$.

    Since our manifold is connected, and $P$ is non-empty (it contains all points in a neighbourhood of $x$ homeomorphic to $\mathbf{R}^n$), $P = M$.
\end{proof}

\begin{corollary}
    Every manifold is locally connected.
\end{corollary}

Corollary (1.3) tells us that any manifold can be split up into the disjoint sum of its connected components. It is therefore interesting to prove theorems about connected manifolds, since any manifold can be build up as a bundle of manifolds of this variety.

\section{Euclidean Neighbourhoods are Open}

In these notes, we consider a neighbourhood in the French sense, as any subset containing an open set, regardless of whether it is open or not. Nonetheless, let $M$ be a manifold, and take a point $p$ with neighbourhood $U$ homeomorphic to $\mathbf{R}^n$, lets say, by some continuous function $f$. Then $U$ contains an open set $V$, and $f(V)$ is open in $\mathbf{R}^n$, so that $f(V)$ contains an open ball $W$ around $f(x)$. But then $W$ is homeomorphic to $\mathbf{R}^n$, and $f^{-1}(W)$ is a neighbourhood of $x$ open in $V$ (and therefore open in $M$) homeomorphic to $\mathbf{R}^n$. This complicated discussion stipulates that we may always choose open neighbourhoods in the definition in a manifold. Remarkably, it turns out that all neighbourhoods homeomorphic to $\mathbf{R}^n$ {\it must} be open; to prove this, we require an advanced theorem.

% Draw construction above

\begin{theorem}[Invariance of Domain]
    If $f:U \to \mathbf{R}^n$ is a continuous, injective function, where $U$ is an open subset of $\mathbf{R}^n$, then $f(U)$ is open, so that $f$ is a homeomorphism.
\end{theorem}

The theorem can be proven after a brief excursion in some basic algebraic topology (homology theory, to be {\it exact}). In an appendix to this chapter, we shall prove the theorem based on the weaker assumption of the Jordan curve theorem. A domain is a connected open set, and this theorem shows that the property of being a domain is invariant under continuous, injective maps from $\mathbf{R}^n$ to itself. In multivariate calculus, the inverse function theorem shows this for differentiable mappings with non-trivial Jacobian matrices across its domain; invariance of domain stipulates that the theorem in fact holds for any such continuous map $f$ on an open domain.

\begin{lemma}
    If a point has two neighbourhoods homeomorphic to Euclidean space, the dimensions of those spaces must be the same.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
    Let $U$ and $V$ be two non-disjoint neighbourhoods of a point homeomorphic to $\mathbf{R}^n$ and $\mathbf{R}^m$ by $f:U \to \mathbf{R}^n$ and $g:V \to \mathbf{R}^m$. Then $U \cap V$ is also open, and therefore we have an injective map $f \circ g^{-1}|_{g(U \cap V)}$ from the set $g(U \cap V)$ open in $\mathbf{R}^n$ to $f(U \cap V)$, open in $\mathbf{R}^m$. If $n < m$, then $\mathbf{R}^n$ is homeomorphic to the hyperplane in $\mathbf{R}^m$ defined by
    %
    \[ P = \{ (x_1, \dots, x_m): x_1 = x_2 = \dots = x_n = 0 \} \]
    %
    Obviously, no subset of $P$ is open. Nonetheless, $f(U \cap V)$, as a subset of $\mathbf{R}^n$, is homeomorphic to a subset of $P$ by an injective map $h: f(U \cap V) \to P$. The map $h \circ f \circ g^{-1}$ is an injective and continuous map from an open subset of $\mathbf{R}^m$ to the rest of $\mathbf{R}^m$. By an appeal to invariance of domain, we conclude the image of the domain is open in $\mathbf{R}^m$. This is in complete contradiction to the fact that the range is a subset of $P$, and shows that the dimensions of the two spaces must be equal.
\end{proof}

\begin{corollary}
    Euclidean spaces are not Homeomorphic: $\mathbf{R}^n \not \cong \mathbf{R}^m$ for $n \neq m$.
\end{corollary}

Because of Lemma 1.5, any point $x$ on a manifold has a unique dimension of euclidean space to which a neighbourhood is mapped. We shall speak of this unique number as the {\bf dimension of the manifold at x}. When a manifold is connected, one can show simply that the dimension across the entire space is invariant, and we may call this the {\bf dimension of the manifold}. An $n$-dimensional manifold $M$ is often denoted $M^n$.

A subtlety that often goes unnoticed is that not a disconnected manifolds might not have a well defined dimension. Logically, the definition of a topological manifold holds just as well, and the following construction becomes clear. If $M$ and $N$ are two different manifolds, then their disjoint union is also a manifold, even if $M$ contains points with dimension 5, and $N$ points with dimension 2364. Unavoidably, any construction of this sort results in a disconnected manifold, and we may break this construction up into its individual connected components, each of which will have a unique dimension.

After some practice, we are now able to prove what we set out to achieve.

\begin{theorem}
    Any subset of a manifold locally homeomorphic to Euclidean space is open in the original topology.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
    Let $M$ be a manifold, and $U$ a subset homeomorphic to $\mathbf{R}^n$ by a function $f$. Let $x \in U$ be arbitrary. We have already established that there is an open neighbourhood $V$ of $x$ that is homeomorphic into $\mathbf{R}^n$ by a function $g$ (the dimension of the space must be the same by the corollary above). Since $V$ is open in $M$, $U \cap V$ is open in $U$, so $f(U \cap V)$ is open in $\mathbf{R}^n$. We obtain a one-to-one continuous function from $f(U \cap V)$ to $g(U \cap V)$ by the function $g \circ f^{-1}$. It follows by invariance of domain that $g(U \cap V)$ is open in $\mathbf{R}^n$, so $U \cap V$ is open in $V$, and, because $V$ is open in $M$, $U \cap V$ is open in $M$. In a complicated manner, we have shown that around every point in $U$ there is an open neighbourhood contained in $U$, so $U$ itself must be open.
\end{proof}

\section{And Now Briefly, Some Boundaries}

As we've introduced manifolds with boundary, we might as well mention a useful theorem about them before we get onto the deeper topics of this chapter.

\begin{theorem}
    If $M^n$ is a manifold with boundary, then $\partial M$, considered as a subspace of $M$, is a manifold (without boundary) of dimension $n-1$.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
    Let $p$ be a point in $\partial M$, and let $U$ be a neighbourhood homeomorphic to $\mathbf{H}^n$ by a map $f:U \to \mathbf{H}^n$. Consider the points in $U$ that map to the boundary plane
    %
    \[ P = \{ q \in U : f(q) = (0,x_2, \dots, x_n) \} \]
    %
    We contend that $P = U \cap \partial M$. Surely this is a subset, since if a point $x \in U$ does not lie on this line, we can select a subneighbourhood which is open in $\mathbf{R}^n$. If a point $x$ lies on this subplane, we cannot find a neighbourhood homeomorphic to $\mathbf{R}^n$, since any neighbourhood of this point in $\mathbf{H}^n$ is not open in $\mathbf{R}^n$, and invariance of domain applies. It is simple to show $U \cap \partial M$, as we have now described it, contains a subneighbourhood homeomorphic to $\mathbf{R}^{n-1}$, and thus we have shown that all points of $\partial M$ have neighbourhoods homeomorphic to $\mathbf{R}^{n-1}$.
\end{proof}

\begin{corollary} A zero dimensional manifold cannot have boundary. \end{corollary}

\section{The Property of `Niceness'}

Many important results in differentiable geometry require more stringent spaces than those that are merely Hausdorff. At times, we will want to restrict ourselves to topological manifolds with these properties. Fortunately, most of these properties are equivalent.

\begin{theorem}
    For any manifold, the following properties are equivalent:
    %
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Every component of the manifold is $\sigma$-Compact.
        \item Every component of the manifold is second countable.
        \item The manifold is metrizable.
        \item The manifold is paracompact (so every compact manifold is metrizable).
    \end{enumerate}
\end{theorem}

We shall break this theorem up into some smaller chunks, since each is a sizable portion to digest, revealing important properties of the manifolds in question.

\begin{lemma}[$1) \to (2$]
    Every $\sigma$-compact, locally second countable space is globally second countable.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
    Let $X$ be a space with the properties above, equal to the union $\bigcup_{i = 1}^\infty A_i$, where each $A_i$ is compact. For each $x$, there is an open neighbourhood $U_x$ with a countable base $\mathcal{C}_x$. If, for some $A_i$, we consider the set of $U_x$ for $x \in A_i$, we obtain a cover, which therefore must have a finite subcover $U_{x_1}, U_{x_2}, \dots, U_{x_n}$. Taking $\bigcup_{i = 1}^n \mathcal{C}_{x_i}$, we obtain a countable base $\mathcal{C}_i$ for all points in a neighbourhood of $A_i$. Then, taking the union $\bigcup_{i = 1}^\infty \mathcal{C}_i$, we obtain a countable base for $X$.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}[$2) \to (3$]
    If a manifold is second countable, then it is metrizable.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
    This is a disguised form the Urysohn metrization theorem, proved in a standard course in general topology, which we unfortunately do not have time to discuss. If you do not have the background, you will have to have faith that this lemma holds. All we need show here is that a second countable manifold is regular, and this follows because every locally compact Hausdorff space is Tychonoff.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}[$3) \to (1$]
    Every connected, locally compact metrizable space is $\sigma$-compact.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
    Consider any connected, locally compact metric space $(X,d)$. For each $x$ in $X$, let
    %
    \[ r(x) = \frac{\sup \{ r \in \mathbf{R} : \overline{B}_r(x)\ \text{is compact} \}}{2} \]
    %
    Since $X$ is locally compact, this function is well defined for all $x$. If $r(x) = \infty$ for any $x$, then $\{ \overline{B}_n(x) : n \in \mathbf{Z} \}$ is a countable cover of the space with compact sets. Otherwise, $r(x)$ is finite for every $x$. Suppose that $d(x,y) + r' < r(x)$. By the triangle inequality, this tells us that $\overline{B}_{r'}(y)$ is a closed subset of $\overline{B}_{r(x)}(x)$, which is hence compact. This shows that, when $d(x,y) < r(x)$,
    %
    \begin{equation} r(y) \geq r(x) - d(x,y) \end{equation}
    %
    Put more succinctly, (1.1) tells us that the function $r:X \to \mathbf{R}$ is continuous:
    %
    \begin{equation} |r(x) - r(y)| < d(x,y) \end{equation}
    %
    This has an important corollary. Consider a compact set $A$, and let
    %
    \begin{equation} A' = \bigcup_{x \in A} \overline{B}_{r(x)}(x) \end{equation}
    %
    We claim that $A'$ is also compact. Consider some sequence $x_1, x_2, \dots$. To show $A'$ is compact, we need only show that some subsequence converges. Consider some sequence $a_1, a_2, \dots$ such that $x_k \in B_{r(a_k)}(a_k)$. Since this sequence is part of the compact set $A$, some subsequence converges to a point $a$. For simplicity, assume the sequence itself converges. By equation (1.2), when $d(a_i, a) < \varepsilon$
    %
    we have $r(a_i) < r(a) + \varepsilon$. Thus eventually, when $d(a_i,a) < r(a)/3$,
    %
    \begin{equation} d(a,x_i) \leq d(a,a_i) + d(a_i,x_i) < r(a)/3 + r(a_i) < r(a)/3 + r(a)/3 = 2r(a)/3 \end{equation}
    %
    Since we chose $r(a)$ to be half the supremum of compact sets, the sequence $x_k$ will eventually end up in the compact ball $B_{3r(a)/4}(a)$, and hence will converge, which shows exactly that $A'$ is compact.

    If $A$ is a compact set, we will let $A'$ be the compact set constructed above. Let $A_0$ consist of an arbitrary point $x_0$ is $X$, and inductively, define $A_{k+1} = A_k'$, and $A = \bigcup_{i = 0}^\infty A_k$. Then $A$ is the union of countably many compact sets. What's more, $A$ is a non-empty clopen set, and hence is equal to $X$. The fact that $A$ is open is trivial, since if $x$ is in $A_k$ for some $k$, then the ball $B_{r(x)}(x)$ is contained in $A_{k+1}$. If $x$ is a limit point of $A$, then there is some sequence $x_1, x_2, \dots$ in $A$ which converges to $x$, so $r(x_i) \to r(x)$. If $|r(x_i) - r(x)| < \varepsilon$, and also $d(x_i,x) < r(x) - \varepsilon$, then $x$ is contained in $B_{r(x_i)}(x_i)$, and hence if $x_i$ is in $A_k$, then $x$ is in $A_{k+1}$. Thus $X = A = \bigcup A_k$ and our space is $\sigma$-compact.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}[$4) \to (1$]
    A connected, locally compact, paracompact space is $\sigma$ compact.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
    Consider a cover $\mathcal{C}$ of a space $X$ of the above variety, where each open set in the cover has compact closure. By the assumption of paracompactness, we may assume the cover is locally finite. Now let $x \in X$ be an arbitrary point. Then $x$ intersects finitely many elements of $\mathcal{C}$, which we may label $U_1, U_2, \dots, U_{n_1}$. Then $U_1 = \overline{U_{1,1}} \cup \overline{U_{1,2}} \cup \dots \cup \overline{U_{{1,n_1}}}$ intersects only finitely many more of $\mathcal{C}$, since the set is compact, and we add finitely more open sets $U_{2,1}, \dots, U_{2,n_2}$, obtaining a set $U_2 = U_1 \cup \overline{U_{2,1}} \cup \dots \cup \overline{U_{2,n_2}}$ Doing this inductively, we obtain a sequence of compact neighbourhoods. We claim the union $\bigcup U_i$ is all of $X$. Openness follows since if $y \in U_k$, then $y$ is in an open set intersected in $U_{k+1}$. If $y$ is a limit point of $\bigcup U_i$, then $y$ is in some $C \in \mathcal{C}$, and $C$ intersects some $U_k$ (otherwise $y$ cannot be in the limit point). Then $y \in C \subset U_{k+1}$ is contained in the next iteration, so $U$ is closed. We conclude $X$ is $\sigma$ compact.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}[$1) \to (4$]
    A $\sigma$ compact, locally compact Hausdorff space is paracompact.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
    Let $X$ be a $\sigma$ compact space, and consider a cover of compact sets $C_1, C_2, \dots$. Since $C_1$ is compact, it is contained in an open neighbourhood $U_1$ with compact closure (take a cover of open sets with compact closure, then take a finite subcover). Similarily, $C_2 \cup \overline{U_1}$ is contained in an open neighbourhood $U_2$ with compact closure. In total, we obtain a chain of open sets $U_1 \subset U_2 \subset \dots$, each with compact closure, and which cover the entire space.

    Now let $\mathcal{U}$ be an arbitrary open cover of $X$. Each $V_k = U_{k+2} - \overline{U_k}$ is open, and its closure $\overline{V_k}$ is a closed subset of compact space, hence compact. Since $\mathcal{U}$ covers $\overline{V_k}$, it has a finite subcover $U_1, \dots, U_n$, and we let
    %
    \[ \mathcal{V}_1 = (U_1 \cap V_1), (U_2 \cap V_1), \dots, (U_n \cap V_1) \]
    %
    be a collection of refined open sets which cover $V_1$. Do the same for each $V_k$, obtaining $\mathcal{V}_2, \mathcal{V}_3, \dots$, and consider $\mathcal{V} = \bigcup \mathcal{V}_i$. Surely this is a cover of $X$, and each point is contained only in $\mathcal{V}_k$ and $\mathcal{V}_{k+1}$ for some $k$, and so this cover is locally finite.
\end{proof}

\section{Nice Manifolds, and a Not so Nice Manifold}

After that arduous proof, lets move onto actually meeting some concrete manifolds. To celebrate our verification of nice manifolds, lets first design a manifold that isn't so nice.

\begin{example}[The Long Line]
    Take the set $\Omega$ of all countable ordinals. Then $\Omega$ is itself an ordinal, and we may consider the space $\Omega \times [0,1)$ together with the dictionary order. The order topology establishes forms a space, the long ray. Now take two copies of the long ray, and attach them at the smallest elements. This create a one-manifold -- the long line. Obviously, the space isn't metrizable -- it contains an uncountable discrete subset, so none of the other nice properties that we considered above hold.
\end{example}

If $M$ and $N$ are manifolds, then $M \times N$ is also a manifold. If $M$ is dimension $m$ at a point $x$, and $N$ is dimension $n$ at a point $y$, then $M \times N$ is dimension $m + n$ at the point $(x,y)$. We therefore obtain another two-manifold (which, if we haven't already mentioned, is known classically as a surface), the shape $S^1 \times S^1$, the torus. More generally, the $n$-torus $S^1 \times S^1 \times \dots \times S^1$ is an $n$-manifold. We could also glue two torii together, to obtain a two holed torus. A classical theorem of topology says that almost all surfaces are of this kind, aside from a few exceptions, which shall be introduced now.

Consider the quotient space obtained by first taking $[0,1] \times (-1,1)$, and then identifying the points $(0,x)$ with $(1,-x)$. The surface created by this twist is known as the M\"{o}bius strip, and has some very strange properties (it only has one edge, even though it exists in three-dimensional space, and if you can make a paper copy, do try cutting it down the middle!).

% The Mobius Strip

These manifolds are still effable to our three-dimensional minds, but we can conjure up surfaces that do not exist in a low dimensional space (but not curves -- all of the nice ones can be represented in $\mathbf{R}^3$). Take the sphere $S^2$, and identify $x$ with $-x$. This is projective space $\mathbf{P}^2$. It is a 2-manifold because locally it behaves exactly like $S^2$; no points infinitely close to each other identified. Even though it is locally trivial, the space is very strange globally, and cannot be embedded in $\mathbf{R}^3$. Nonetheless, we see it every day -- the topology of how the eye projects space down to our two dimensional vision is modelled very accurately by the spherical construction of projective space. Of course, we don't see the really weird part of $\mathbf{P}^2$ -- that occurs when we take the entire projective sphere, which we cannot see since part of our eye is obscured.

More generally, we can take $\mathbf{P}^n$ as the quotient space of $S^{n}$ identifying opposite points. If you give the construction a bit of a fiddle, you will see that $\mathbf{P}^2$ is just a M\"{o}bius strip with a disc attached -- these strange shapes are intrically connected together.

To obtain explicit homeomorphisms from $\mathbf{P}^2$ to $\mathbf{R}^2$, define a map $f$ from $S^n$ to $\mathbf{R}^n$ by
%
\[ (x_1, \dots, x_n) \mapsto (\frac{x_1}{x_i}, \frac{x_2}{x_i}, \dots, \frac{x_{i-1}}{x_i}, \frac{x_{i + 1}}{x_i}, \dots, \frac{x_n}{x_i}) \]
%
Clearly the function is a continuous map from $S^n$ to $\{ (0,,\dots,1,\dots,0) \}$, and $f(x) = -f(x)$. We therefore obtain an induced map $f':\mathbf{P}^n \to \mathbf{R}^n$, which is continuous since the projection map from $S^n$ to $\mathbf{P}^n$ is open. What's more, this map has an inverse, since if
%
\[ \frac{1}{x_i}(x_1, \dots, x_{i-1}, x_{i+1}, \dots, x_n) = \frac{1}{y_i} (y_1, \dots, y_{i-1}, y_{i+1}, \dots y_n) \]
%
Then, for each $j \neq i$, $y_i x_j = x_i y_j$. Thus
%
\[ y_i^2 = y_i^2(\sum_j x_j^2) = \sum_j (y_ix_j)^2 = \sum_{j \neq i} (x_iy_j)^2 + (y_ix_i)^2 = x_i^2(\sum y_j^2) = x_i^2 \]
%
So $y_i = \pm x_i$, and from this, $x = \pm y$. Thus the map from $\mathbf{P}^2$ is injective, and has a continuous inverse given by
%
\[ (x_1, \dots, x_{n-1}) \mapsto \left[\frac{1}{\|x\| + 1} (x_1, \dots, 1, \dots, x_{n-1})\right] \]
%
Thus $\mathbf{P}^n$ is a manifold.


Our final shape is obtained by taking two M\"{o}bius strips, and zipping them up together along their boundary. The shape formed is well-known to many a hobbyist mathematician -- the famous Klein bottle.

We've talked enough about topology for now -- we need to get to some differentiation.

\section{Appendix: A Proof of Invariance of Domain}

For this section, we will prove invariance of domain, relying on two previous theorems. It sure takes a lot to build up to this theorem, but the result is worth every penny.

\begin{theorem}[The Generalized Jordan Curve Theorem]
    Every subspace $X$ of $\mathbf{R}^n$ homeomorphic to $S^{n-1}$ splits $\mathbf{R}^n - X$ into two components, and $X$ is the boundary of each.
\end{theorem}

\begin{theorem}
    If a subspace $Y$ of $\mathbf{R}^n$ is homeomorphic to the unit disc $D^n$, then $\mathbf{R}^n - Y$ is connected.
\end{theorem}

We'll put on the finishing touches to Invariance of Domain now. Hopefully this will give you intuition to why the theorem is true.

\begin{lemma}
    One of the components of $\mathbf{R}^n - X$ is bounded, and the other is unbounded. We call the bounded component the {\bf inside} of $X$, and the unbounded component the {\bf outside}.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
    Since $X$ is homeomorphic to $S^n$, it is a compact set, and therefore contained in some ball $B$. $\mathbf{R}^n - B$ is connected, so therefore one component of $\mathbf{R}^n - X$ is contained within $B$. Since $B$ is bounded, this component is bounded. If both components are bounded, we conclude that the union of the two components plus $X$ is bounded, a contradiction. Therefore one component must be unbounded, and the other must be bounded.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}
    If $U \subset \mathbf{R}^n$ is open, $A \subset U$ is homeomorphic to $S^n$, $f:U \to \mathbf{R}^n$ is one-to-one and continuous, and $A \cup (\text{inside of}\ A)$ is homeomorphic to $D^n$. Then $f(\text{inside of}\ A) = (\text{inside of}\ f(A))$.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
    Since $f$ is continuous, $f(\text{inside of}\ A)$ is connected, and is therefore contained either entirely within the outside of $f(A)$ or the inside of $f(A)$. The same is true of $f(\text{outside of}\ A)$. The difference is that, due to compactness, $f(A \cup (\text{inside of}\ A))$ is homeomorphic to $A \cup (\text{inside of}\ A)$, and in connection, homeomrphic to $D^n$. Therefore $\mathbf{R}^n - f(A \cup \text{inside of}\ A)$ is connected. It follows that $f(\text{inside of}\ A)$ is a component of $\mathbf{R}^n - f(A)$, so it is equal to either the inside of outside of space. Since $f(\text{inside of}\ A)$ is contained within a bounded ball, we conclude that it is equal to the inside.
\end{proof}

\begin{theorem}[Invariance of Domain]
    If $f:U \to \mathbf{R}^n$ is an injective continuous function, where $U$ is an open subset of $\mathbf{R}^n$, then $f(U)$ is open, and therefore $f$ is homeomorphic onto its image.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
    Let $V$ be an arbitrary open subset of $U$. We must show $f(V)$ is also open. Let $x \in V$ be arbitrary, and consider a closed ball $\overline{B}$ containing $x$, and contained in $V$. The boundary of $\overline{B}$ is homeomorphic to $S^{n-1}$, and the interior $B$ is equal to the inside of $\overline{B}$. By the lemma (2.4) above, we conclude that
    %
    \[ f(B) = \text{inside of}\ f(\partial B) \]
    %
    Since $\partial B$ is closed in $\mathbf{R}^n$, the inside is open, hence $f(B)$ is open. By an extension of this argument, we have shown the the image of any open set is open, so invariance of domain is proved.
\end{proof}

The Jordan Curve theorem still remains to be proven, as is the theorem following it. Both require quite advanced techniques in algebraic topology. Hopefully, the results seem intuitive enough that the theorem now should be `correct' in your mind, so we can leave the algebra for another time. Do check it out some time though, since the techniques are quite beautiful!







\chapter{Differentiable Structures}

We know when a map $f:M \to N$ between manifolds is continuous, but how do we decide when the map is differentiable? Given a correspondence $y = f(x)$, a viable notion would be to consider local homeomorphisms (hereafter called charts) $\Phi:U \to \mathbf{R}^n$ and $\Psi:V \to \mathbf{R}^m$ into open subsets of $\mathbf{R}^m$ from local neighbourhoods $U$ of $x$ and $V$ of $y$. We can consider $f$ differentiable at $x$ if $\Phi \circ f \circ \Psi^{-1}$ is differentiable at $\Psi(x)$. Unfortunately, this idea is doomed to fail, for we can hardly expect any such homeomorphism is differentiable if some such differentiable is. For instance, if $\Phi \circ f \circ \Psi$ is differentiable, then for any chart $\Delta$ whose domain contains $f(x)$,
%
\[ \Delta \circ f \circ \Psi = (\Delta \circ \Phi^{-1}) \circ \Phi \circ f \circ \Psi \]
%
is differentiable if and only if $\Delta \circ \Phi^{-1}$ is differentiable also. Clearly we can choose some non-differentiable homeomorphism $g$ of $\mathbf{R}^n$, and then $\Delta = g \circ \Phi^{-1}$ will prevent our naive definition of differentiability from being realized. As was alluded before, and now affirmed, the only way out of this dilemma is to identify additional structure to our manifolds. We shall say that there are some charts, such as $\Phi$ and $\Psi$, which are `correct' in some sense, and that we should not consider strange and unnatural charts like $\Delta$, which are not differentiably invariant.

\begin{definition}
    Two maps $x:U \to \mathbf{R}^n$ and $y:V \to \mathbf{R}^m$ whose domains are open are {\bf C$^k$ related}, for $1 < k < \infty$,s if $U$ and $V$ are disjoint, or
    %
    \[ y \circ x^{-1} : x(U \cap V) \to y(U \cap V) \]
    %
    \[ x \circ y^{-1} : y(U \cap V) \to x(U \cap V) \]
    %
    are $C^k$ functions.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}
    A $C^k$ {\bf atlas} for a manifold is a non-empty family of $C^k$ charts whose domains cover the manifold. A manifold together with a maximal atlas is called a {\bf differentiable manifold}.
\end{definition}

Charts are meant to be identified as ways to assign coordinates to some subset of a manifold. As such, we use notation such as $x$ and $y$ to make concrete the metaphor between the manifold and cartesian space. Think of a chart as laying down a blanket down onto your manifold. An atlas is a collection of charts that have been flattened out - make sure that when you lie them down, you watch that they don't contain any creases!

It is uncomfortable to construct a maximal atlas explicitly. Fortunately, we do not need to specify every single valid chart in our manifold.

\begin{lemma}
    Every atlas is contained in a unique maximal atlas.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
Let $\mathcal{A}$ be an atlas for a manifold $M$, and consider the set $\mathcal{A}'$, which is the union of all atlases containing $\mathcal{A}$. We shall show that $\mathcal{A}'$ is also an atlas, and therefore necessarily the unique maximal one. Let $x:U \to \mathbf{R}^n$ and $y:V \to \mathbf{R}^n$ be two charts in $\mathcal{A}'$ with non-disjoint domain, containing a point $p$. Let $z:W \to \mathbf{R}^n$ be a chart in $\mathcal{A}$ containing $p$. Then, on $U \cap V \cap W$, an open set containing $p$, we have
%
\[ x \circ y^{-1} = (x \circ z^{-1}) \circ (z \circ y^{-1}) \]
%
and by assumption, each component map is $C^k$ on this domain, so $x \circ y^{-1}$ is differentiable at $p$. The proof for $y \circ x^{-1}$ is exactly the same. Since the point $p$ was arbitrary, we conclude that $x$ and $y$ are $C^k$ related across their domains, and therefore $C^k$ in full. $\mathcal{A}'$ is therefore an atlas.
\end{proof}

Because of our argument above, we may consider some sub-maximal atlas to be a generating basis set for a maximal atlas of a differential manifold. A manifold will normally be given with such a minute set, not unlike the basis of a topological space or vector space. Furthermore, in consequence of lemma (2.1), in order to verify that $x$ is a chart on some manifold $M$ with generating set $\mathcal{A}$, we need only verify that $x$ is $C^\infty$ related to each map in $\mathcal{A}$. Unsurprisingly, the differentiable manifold $\mathbf{R}^n$ is defined by a minute atlas, consisting only of the identity function $\mathbf{1}:\mathbf{R}^n \to \mathbf{R}^n$. charts on $\mathbf{R}^n$ are injective functions $x:U \to \mathbf{R}^n$ such that $x$ and $x^{-1}$ is $C^\infty$. Nothing can stop us, however, from considering a differentiable structure (maximal atlas) on $\mathbf{R}$ by a different generating set $\mathcal{A} = \{ x \}$, where $x$ is the homeomorphism $t \mapsto t^3$. The inverse of this function is not differentiable in the normal sense, but in our new manifold, which we denote by $\mathbf{R}_1$, can be considered so. Unless otherwise, the identity map provides the canonical structure for $\mathbf{R}^n$.

With a differentiable structure in hands, we may now consider differentiable morphisms in our category of objects.

\begin{definition}
    A map $f:M \to N$ between two differentiable manifolds is {\bf $\mathbf{C^k}$ differentiable} if, for every chart $(x,U)$ on $M$ and $(y,V)$ on $N$, where $(f \circ x)(U) \cap V$ is non-disjoint, the map $y \circ f \circ x^{-1}: x(U \cap f^{-1}(V)) \to \mathbf{R}^n$ is $C^k$. A differentiable bijective function whose inverse is differentiable is known as a {\bf diffeomorphism}.
\end{definition}

Most of the next few theorems can be justified by the fact that $C^\infty$ related charts are related to each other in a differentiable manner. Use the next few arguments to gain intuition about this fact. We say a map $f:M \to N$ is {\bf differentiable at a point $p \in M$} if there is a chart $x$ containing $p$ and a chart $y$ containing $f(p)$, such that $y \circ f \circ x^{-1}$ is differentiable at $x(p)$.

\begin{theorem}
    If a map $f$ is differentiable at a point $p$ in charts $x$ and $y$, it is differentiable at $p$ for any other charts containing $p$ and $f(p)$.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
    Suppose $y \circ f \circ x^{-1}$ is differentiable at a point $x(p)$, and consider any other charts $y'$ and $x'$. Then
    %
    \[ y' \circ f \circ x'^{-1} = (y' \circ y^{-1}) \circ (y \circ f \circ x^{-1}) \circ (x \circ x'^{-1}) \]
    %
    On a smaller neighbourhood than was considered, though still open. Nonetheless, since differentiability is a local concept, we need only prove the theorem for this map on a reduced domain. The end components are $C^k$ related and therefore differentiable, and by assumption, the middle map is differentiable, so the full map is $C^k$ on a neighbourhood containing $x'(p)$.
\end{proof}

\begin{corollary}
    If a map is differentiable at all points on its domain, it is differentiable in the original sense.
\end{corollary}
\begin{proof}
    Consider a map $f:M \to N$, and let $x$ be a chart on $M$, and $y$ a chart on $N$. Suppose $f$ is differentiable at any point on its domain. By the antecendent theorem, $x \circ f \circ y^{-1}$ is differentiable at any point $p$, and therefore across its whole domain domain. This means the map is differentiable as defined previously.
\end{proof}

\begin{theorem}
    A map $f:M \to N$ between manifolds is a diffeomorphism iff the map from charts on $N$ to charts on $M$ defined by $x \mapsto x \circ f$ is a bijection of the atlas' of the two manifolds.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
    Suppose $f$ is a diffeomorphism, and let $x$ be a chart on $N$. To verify that $x \circ f$ is a chart on $N$, we need only check it is $C^k$ related to any other chart in the atlas of $M$. But this is just the definition of a diffeomorphism. Conversely, if $x \circ f$ is a chart on $M$, for some map $x$, then the previous argument shows, since $f^{-1}$ is also a diffeomorphism, that $x = x \circ f \circ f^{-1}$ is a chart on $N$. The converse is trivial.
\end{proof}

\begin{theorem}
    The manifold $\mathbf{R}_1$ with atlas generated by $\{ \mathbf{1} \}$ is diffeomorphic to $\mathbf{R}_2$ with the atlas specified by $\{ x:t \mapsto t^3 \}$.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
    We will let $x:\mathbf{R}_2 \to \mathbf{R}_1$ itself be our diffeomorphism. It is surely bijective. Let $y$ be a chart on $\mathbf{R}_2$. We must verify that $y = z \circ x$, where $z$ is a chart on $\mathbf{R}_1$. We may show this by verifying that $y \circ x^{-1} = z$ is $C^k$ on $\mathbf{R}_1$. But this was exactly why $y$ was a chart on $\mathbf{R}_2$ in the first place.
\end{proof}

Many categorical structures carry across to the category of differentiable manifolds. If $M$ and $N$ are differentiable manifolds, we may consider the product $M \times N$, we consists of the topological product of $M$ and $N$, with the differentiable structure consisting of all maps $x_1 \times x_2$, where $x_1$ is a chart on $M$ and $x_2$ is a chart on $N$. It is simple to verify that the projection maps from $M \times N$ to $M$, and $N$, are differentiable.

Similarily, if $U$ is an open subset of a manifold $M$, then we may assign a differentiable structure to $U$. It consists of all charts $x$ on $M$, whose domain is a subset of $U$. This gives $U$ a maximal atlas, and if any map $f:M \to N$ is differentiable, then the restriction map $f|U:U \to N$ is also differentiable. We call $U$ an {\bf open submanifold} of $M$.

Before we continue, some clarifications should be made on behalf of several years of training in ordinary calculus, which should be verified to enable an understanding of the abstract concepts developed. Based on previous discussion, verifying these statements should be trivial.

\begin{enumerate}
    \item A function $f: \mathbf{R}^n \to \mathbf{R}^m$ is differentiable in the context of manifolds if and only if it is differentiable in the usual sense.
    \item A chart on $\mathbf{R}^n$ is just a differentiable map $x: \mathbf{R}^n \to \mathbf{R}^n$ with a differentiable inverse on its range.
    \item A function $f: M \to \mathbf{R}^n$ is differentiable if and only if each component function $f_i$ is differentiable.
    \item Every coordinate system $x:U \to \mathbf{R}^n$ is a diffeomorphism from $U$ to $x(U)$, viewed as an open submanifold of $\mathbf{R}^n$.
\end{enumerate}

The use of $C^\infty$ functions relies on the fact that manifolds possess them in plenty. The following theorem gives us our first plethora to use. First, we detail some $C^\infty$ functions on $\mathbf{R}^n$.

\begin{enumerate}
    \item The map $f:\mathbf{R} \to \mathbf{R}$, defined by $f(t) = e^{-t^{-2}}$, is $C^\infty$. It is 0 at 0, positive everywhere, and bounded by 1 everywhere else.
    \item The $C^\infty$ map $g:\mathbf{R} \to \mathbf{R}$ defined by
    %
    \[
    g(t) =
    \begin{cases} 
        f(t - 1)f(t + 1) & : t \in (-1, 1) \\
        0 & : \text{elsewise}
    \end{cases}
    \]
    %
    is positive on $(-1,1)$, and zero everywhere else.
    \item Similarily, for any $\varepsilon$, there is a map $g_\varepsilon$ which is positive on $(-\varepsilon, \varepsilon)$ and zero elsewhere.
    \item The map 
    %
    \[ l(t) = \begin{cases}
        \left(\int_{-\varepsilon}^{t - \varepsilon} g_\varepsilon \right)/\left(\int_{-\varepsilon}^\varepsilon g_\varepsilon \right) & : t \in (0, \infty) \\
        0 & : \text{elsewise}
    \end{cases} \]
    %
    is $C^\infty$, is zero for negative $t$, increasing on $(0, 2\varepsilon)$, and one on $[2\varepsilon, \infty)$.
    \item There is a differentiable map $h:\mathbf{R}^n \to \mathbf{R}$ defined by $h(x_1, \dots, x_n) = g(x_1) g(x_2) \dots g(x_n)$ is positive on $(-1, 1)^n$, and zero elsewhere.
\end{enumerate}

With these nice functions in hand, we may form them on arbitrary manifolds.

\begin{theorem}
    If $M$ is a differentiable manifold, and $C$ is a compact set contained in an open set $U$, then there is a differentiable function $f:M \to \mathbf{R}$ such that $f(x) = 1$ for $x$ in $C$, and whose support $\overline{\{ x \in M : f(x) \neq 0 \}}$ is contained entirely within $U$.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
    For each point $p$ in $C$, consider a chart $(x,V)$ around $p$, with $\overline{V} \subset U$, and $x(V)$ containing the open unit square $(-1,1)^n$ in $\mathbf{R}^n$. We may clearly select a finite subset of these charts $(x_k,V_k)$ such that the $x_k^{-1}((-1,1)^n)$ cover $C$. We may define a map $f_k:V_k \to \mathbf{R}$ equal to $h \circ x_k$, where $h$ is defined above. It clearly remains $C^\infty$ if we extend it to be zero outside of $V_k$. Then $\sum f_k$ is positive on $C$, and whose closure is contained within $\bigcup \overline{V_k} \subset U$. Since $C$ is compact, and the function is continuous, $\sum f_k$ is bounded below by $\varepsilon$ on $C$. Taking $f = l \circ (\sum f_k)$, where $l$ is defined above, we obtain the map needed.
\end{proof}

Lets work backwards on manifolds. We have derivatives, but how do we define partial derivative? Consider a differentiable map from a manifold to the real numbers $f:M \to \mathbf{R}$. We have no conventional coordinates to consider partial derivatives on, but take any chart $x:U \to \mathbf{R}^n$ on $M$. We obtain a $C^\infty$ map $f \circ x^{-1}$, which therefore has continuous partial derivatives of all orders. We define, for a point $p \in U$,
%
\[ \frac{\partial f}{\partial x_k} (p) = D_k(f \circ x^{-1})(x(p)) \]
%
We are tracing the coordinates lines placed on $U$ by the map $x^{-1}$; literally, if $c$ is a curve defined by $c(t) = (f \circ x^{-1})(x(p) + tx_k)$, then $c'(0) = \frac{\partial f}{\partial x_k}(p)$. In this sense, the chain rule holds as well.

\begin{theorem}
    If $x$ and $y$ are coordinate systems at a point $p$, and $f:M \to \mathbf{R}$ is differentiable, then
    %
    \[ \frac{\partial f}{\partial x_i} = \sum \frac{\partial y_j}{\partial x_i} \frac{\partial f}{\partial y_j} \]
    %
    As in convention with Einstein notation, if an index is repeated twice, the sum is over that index.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
    We just apply the chain rule in euclidean space.
    %
    \begin{align*}
        \frac{\partial f}{\partial x_i}(p) = D_i(f \circ x^{-1})(x(p)) &= D_i((f \circ y^{-1}) \circ (y \circ x^{-1}))(x(p))\\
        &= \sum D_j(f \circ y^{-1})(y(p)) D_i(y_j \circ x^{-1})(x(p))\\
        &= \sum \frac{\partial f}{\partial y_j}(p) \frac{\partial y_j}{\partial x_i}(p)
    \end{align*}
\end{proof}
