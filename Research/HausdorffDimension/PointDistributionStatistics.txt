Conjecture: Dividing by MN, average square distance is O_M(1/N)

Chebyshev's inequality implies P(Dist > 1/sqrt(N)) <= O_M(1)
So for some A_M, P(Dist > A_M/sqrt(N)) <= 1/4. Does it help
us if most distances are small? Probably not, since this will probably
yield a dimension 1/2 set.

For M = 100
	N = 10000
