Preface

- Main point: Philosophy makes an error when it tries to draw metaphysical conclusions about the way things are  apart from understanding the basis and extent to which we can obtain knowledge about the world.

- How can one know knowledge of universal claims?
	- Some facts are 'cotingent', they just happen to be true, by coincidence (e.g. all the coins in my wallet are silver).
	- Some facts are 'necessary', they 'have' to be true (the sum of the angles in a triangle is 180 degrees).

	- Because we think certain facts are necessary, they can be generalized to universal claims, whereas cotingent facts may not be generalized.

	- Since sensory observations only deal with 'past' objects, they never tell us anything about 'future' objects.

	- A claim is 'a priori' if it cannot be established by sensory experience, and is necessary and universal.
	- A claim is 'a posteriori' if it is based on the evidence of the senses.

	- Philosophers before and after Kant argued that one can establish some a priori claims because of the meaning of the words in these claims (e.g. all bachelors are unmarried).

	- An 'analytic' claim is a claim in which the predicate concept is 'thought in' the subject concept.
	- A 'synthetic' claim is a claim in which this is not true.

	- Thus the problem of obtaining a priori analytic knowledge is settled.

	- If all a priori knowledge was analytic, there would be no problem in obtaining all relevant a priori knowledge. But Kant argues that this cannot be the case, since if all a priori knowledge was subject to relations between the meanings of ideas, none of this knowledge would ever have any application to the real world.

	- The goal of the book is to determine when synthetic, a posteriori claims are possible.

	- Kant agrees with the Empiricists, that all knowledge begins from sensory experience. But he questioned whether some knowledge also arises from the way our mind deals with sensory experience.

	- Kant's slam dunk: some a priori synthetic claims are necessarily true, because these claims are necessary if we are ever going to have knowledge in the first place. Knowledge established via this method Kant calls 'trancendental philosophy'.








DEFINITIONS:

Experience: Knowledge of objects gained by processing sensory perceptions.

A Priori Knowledge: Knowledge independent of experience. Contrasted with 'A Posteriori' knowledge.

Pure A Priori Knowledge: Knowledge involving no empirical concepts. The proposition "Every change has its cause is a priori, but not purely a priori, since the concept of change can only be obtained by experience".




Apperception: The faculty or capacity for judging according with a rule, for applying concepts. An activity necessary and parallel to perceiving. To achieve recognition of a unified object, the mind must perform an act of judgment; it must find how various represented elements are connected to one another.

Distinctness and Clarity: Kant uses the concepts of distinctness and clarity, as developed by Descartes, and later refined by Locke and Leibniz. Very roughly speaking, an idea is 'clear' if it can be distinguished from al other ideas. An idea is 'distinct' if all of the characteristics that make up the idea are clear, and these characteristics are each clear individually, so that the overarching idea can be distinguished from other ideas by abstracting from its component parts. But Kant may mean more by distinctness than this definition, since he discusses discursive distinctness (through the clarity of the arguments concepts) and intuitive distinctness (through the clarity of the examples that make up the argument)

Presentation and Intuition: A presentation is an object of our direct awareness. An intuition is an immediate representation of an object.

Unconditioned Knowledge: An Ultimate explanation of something, i.e. a because that admits of no further because.









Introduction A

Our unending desire for understanding, and the process of reasoning itself, causes us to seek knowledge beyond our immediate sensory experience, including those that reason itself cannot answer. The task of seeking new knowledge is unending, and causes us to use reasoning techniques no longer referring to any sensory experience. This is what Kant calls metaphysics.

Beyond the realm of experience, human reasoning has no intuition about how to think, and thus invites many contradictions into the reasoning process. The enlightenment has made an analysis of these problems more rigorous, so that the contradictions of metaphysics are brought into the light. An effect of this judgement is that, at the point of the writing of Kant's critique, most scientists have become indifferent to attempts to figure things out. But this indifference is futile, since metaphysics are part of human nature, and must be examined. Kant desires to resolve this by critically analyzing the power of human thought to consider knowledge independent of experience. In this resolution, he aims to obtain 'complete' principles with which to conduct metaphysics, since one cannot obtain deeper knowledge through sensory experience that would change knowledge of metaphysics. One might make a comparison to pure logic, which is limited to understanding the forms of arguments, but is able to give a complete picture in this scenario.

Because metaphysics is so unreliable, we must be certain about the claims we make about metaphysics itself; one should have no opinions or hypothesis about metaphysics, but only certainty (any cognition that is to hold a priori proclaims on its own that it wants to be regarded as absolutely necessary). Is this Cartesian skepticism?

Kant had previously thought about the power of understanding in the second chapter of his book 'the Trancendental Analytic', in an essay entitled 'Deduction of the Pure Concepts of Understanding'. In this essay he also discussed the question of 'how' thought is possible. This discussion implicitly assumes that every effect has a cause (the effect of thinking must be caused by something), which seems like a hypothesis (Kant says he will argue it isn't a hypothesis later).









Introduction B

Logic is only the start of a firm science, since one must look elsewhere to acquire knowledge we must judge via logic.

When someone studies geometry from the perspective of greek demonstrations, they do not gain knowledge by what they see in the figure (i.e. through sensory experience). Instead, they gain information apriori, gaining information from what follows necessarily from the concepts of geometry he himself has started with. This is the revolution that lead to so much firm knowledge being gained in Science.

When scientists started conducting experiments, they realized they do not gain information just be observing sensory information, but instead using principles to devise experiments that compel nature to either answer, or not to answer, to these principles. Otherwise our observations are coincidental, they have no plan at all, and cannot be used to gain firm knowledge. This is the revolution that lead to so much firm knowledge being gained in Science.

On the other hand, metaphysics, the core of all cognition, has not had such a revolution and gained firm knowledge about the core concepts of reality. Kant's main idea is to switch from assuming that knowledge and intuitions should be judged by how they conform to a particular object or concept, and instead to assume that the *experience* of an object or concept must conform to a particular concept. This is justified because one can only gain knowledge through sensory experience via understanding that experience, and so experience must conform to the rules of understanding. One can then abstract these rules of thought to knowledge gained without sensory experience. This flipped perspective fits metaphysics really well, because we want to discover knowledge about concepts which we are unable to judge separately using sensory experience. By applying this method, we will come to realize that all knowledge gained a priori about things is what we put into them ourselves (THINK ABOUT WHAT THIS MEANS LATER).

An important point is that by making metaphysics more concrete also means making more clear the boundary of this knowledge. Kant provides an example on how logic is complete by means of limiting it's scope of knowledge to a comprehensive exposition of the formal rules of thought, and nothing else. One consequence of Kant's technique is a realization that we shall never be able to gain knowledge beyond the boundaries of *possible* experience (Kant also argued this on a separate basis in his other work, "The Trancendental Analytic").

One of the demands of rationality is that it compels us to demand unconditional knowledge. In particular, it assumes 'the unconditioned is given', i.e. that there exists ultimate explanations for any knowledge. We are also compelled to think of metaphysical objects ('souls', 'god') as objects that exist independently of the mind.

 This is a demand that we cannot dismiss.


Suppose that we could not obtain this unconditional knowledge purely by the appearance of objects, but rather only by the way they are by themselves (a thing-in-itself). If this is true, 


COME BACK TO THIS














INTRODUCTION

I On The Distinction Between Pure and Empirical Cognition

All knowledge begins with a sensory experience. The objects of which we experience bring about presentations of these objects in the mind. The mind then compares these presentations, connects them, separates them, processing the raw sensory data into what we call *experience*. But that does mean that all knowledge results from sensory experience, e.g. new knowledge may be obtained through prior knowledge in the mind, combined with sensory experience. Our mind does this so subtly that we may not even realize we have used the prior knowledge. For instance, when someone digs under their house, we do not have to wait for experience to know that the house will probably cave in.

Empirical knowledge is knowledge ONLY possible by a posteriori knowledge. Pure a priori knowledge is knowledge involving no empirical concepts. The proposition "Every change has its cause is a priori, but not purely a priori, since the concept of change can only be obtained by experience". It is a central question of this work whether it is possible to obtain pure, a priori knowledge.

II We Are In Possession of Certain A Priori Cognitions, And Even Common Understanding Is Never Without Them

Experience tells us that a proposition is true, but it does not tell us that it cannot be otherwise. Thus experience can tell us nothing about the *necessity* of a proposition. Thus a proposition 'strictly' involving necessity is an a priori judgement.

Secondly, no experience can tell us an unlimited universal truth, only some approximation to a universal truth via induction (an *empirical universality*, such as the statement 'all bodies have weight'). Thus strictly universal propositions must also be apriori.

A mathematical statement is therefore a practical example of pure a priori knowledge, since it applies to any object whatsoever, and therefore is entirely universal. (Question: Why does Kant think necessity matters here?)

One example of pure a priori knowledge is a certainty in our access to sensory information. This cannot be an a posteriori statement, because then it would have to be gained by experience. The human mind strives seeks an ultimate explanation for things, and this line of reasoning would suggest that there is no universal source for this knowledge. Thus it cannot be true that the statement is gained by experience.

Another example is the knowledge of the concept of a body. Suppose you omit all experience of the concept of the body, i.e. its hardness or softness, its color, its weight. But then you would still have knowledge of the space occupied by the body. Thus the concept of space in which objects lie is pure apriori knowledge. (Question: Is Space different from position, i.e. what you see with your eyes?)

III Philosophy Needs a Science That Will Determine The Possibility, The Principles, And The Range Of All Apriori Cognitions

There are also certain pieces of knowledge that go beyond a priori knowledge about objects perceived by experience, but even leave the realm of experience itself. For instance, these include the concepts of God, Freedom, or Immortality. Inquiries into these objects is called metaphysics. We view these inquiries as so sublime that we often approach them dogmatically, without even inquiring whether it is even possible to obtain knowledge of such concepts. This seems very risky. Instead, we should take time to study the questions of understanding of these concepts, without having to take such a huge perilous leap of faith into the unknown.

One problem with metaphysical studies is that none of our arguments can ever be refuted by experience. The only thing stopping us from our studies is a clear contradiction.

IV On The Distinction Between Analytic and Synthetic Judgements

One can further categorize types of knowledge involving a predicate and a subject. The first, in which knowledge of the subject is contained in the predicate, is called *analytic* knowledge. Other statements are called *synthetic* knowledge. One way to think of analytic knowledge is that it does not really tell us anything new about certain objects, but only elucidates our prior knowledge of them. An example of an analytic a priori statement is "all physical bodies are extended". Verifying the truth of this statement just means to break apart my understanding of the term 'body'. The statement "All bodies have mass", on the other hand, is not an analytic a priori statement, because, though mass and body are related concepts, the property of mass is not contained in the definition of body, and so the proposition is synthetic. All experiential knowledge is synthetic, and all analytic statements are a priori.

The difficult question is whether it is possible to have *a priori synthetic knowledge*. To be synthetic means to go beyond knowledge contained in the definitions of concepts, but being a priori, one cannot gain this knowledge from experience, and so one must go beyond in a different sense. Consider the proposition "Everything that happens has a cause". The unlimited universality of this statement means the statement is a priori, but it is not analytic knowledge since something happening does not necessarily have a cause. But can one obtain the truth of this knowledge (Question: Is something that happens necessarily something existing in the physical world, and therefore one can treat this proposition as empirical?)

V All Theoretical Sciences of Reason Contain Synthetic A Priori Judgements As Principles

In mathematics, the choice of axioms is synthetic? (Question: Is This What Kant is Arguing? Does Modern Mathematics Fix The Synthetic Part of Reasoning?) Physical principles are synthetic a priori judgements, i.e. the conservation of matter, or momentum. Metaphysics *must* have apriori judgements, because it wants to obtain truth, rather than just to elucidate concepts. (Question: In philosophy do we answer questions, or just elucidate knowledge).

Because all theoretical sciences contain synthetic a priori judgements, a certain mystery lies concealed there that is integral to rigourousely study if we want to make our understanding of knowledge secure and reliable.

VI The General Problem of Pure Reason

We now have some examples of practical synthetic judgements, in which to judge our forthcoming study of the basis of establishing synthetic a priori judgements. Since the concept of synthetic judgements has not been introduced before, there has been relatively little work on study whether one can establish synthetic a priori judgements. The only person to have come close is David Hume, who worked with the particular proposition "all effects have a cause". He believed it is impossible to establish the truth of this proposition a priori, and that metaphysics is itself a cause of mistaking synthetic a priori knowledge with reasoning about empirical knowledge we have dealt with often enough that we treat it as true habitually. But from our standpoint this clearly cannot be true, for otherwise, as we have argued in V, mathematics and physics would have no grounding. In solving this main problem, we will therefore also answer the question of how pure mathematics and physics is possible. By doing this, we give metaphysics the grounding of a science that prevents the production of baseless assertions leading to the philosophy of skepticism (Question: Ask about skepticism).

VII Idea and Division Of a Special Science Under The Name Of Critique Of Pure Reason

Pure reason is that component of reason that contains the principles for gaining knowledge absolutely a priori. This book is entitled a *critique* of pure reason, because it is a science that only judges pure reason, its sources, and its limitations, serving as a preliminary study of the sum of all principles for which all pure a priori knowledge can be acquired.

Knowledge is *transcendental* if it deals not with objects, but knowledge of our way of gaining knowledge about objects in general, predicated on the belief that gaining knowledge about objects is possible. A system of this knowledge would be called *transcendental philosophy*. (Question: Why is analytic transcendental knowledge not compelte? Is it complete nowadays? Can one `complete' the analysis?)

The basic concepts of morality and god will not come into play here; they are not part of transcendental philosophy, even though they are objects we must concieve of a priori, most of the propositions of that subject do involve experiential knowledge, i.e. pleasure and pain and desire.

Human cognition has two components: *sensibility* and *understanding*. Through sensibility, we obtain objects upon which we desire to gain knowledge. Though understanding they are thought about. The former precedes the latter, and so we will begin with a study of this first.

(Question: I'm not convinced about the argument that we can complete transcendental philosphy because it's lal in our head)




Both necessity and universality are linked (if something is necessary, it is true in all possible)

* and they do more over belong together inseparably *






Question: What do we mean by 'we think at the same time'?

Secondly, no experience can tell us 'strictly' *universal* truth of a proposition, though only with assumed universality (Question: What do we mean by strictly).

Question: I Think, I Exist, If I Think, Then I Exist. Which of these propositions is a priori / synthetic?

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peano_axioms


A) I Think
B) I Exist
C) If I Think, Then I Exist
D) For any object, if that object thinks, then that object exists.












DO NOT UNDERSTAND THIS YET:

For what necessarily impels
us to go beyond the boundary of experience and of all appearances is the
unconditioned that reason demands in things84 in themselves; reason­
necessarily and quite rightfully-demands this unconditioned for every­
thing conditioned, thus demanding that the series of conditions be com­
pleted by means of that unconditioned
