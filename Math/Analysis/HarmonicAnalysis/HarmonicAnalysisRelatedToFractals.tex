\chapter{Riemann's Theory of Trigonometric Series}

Using the techniques of measure theory, we can actually prove that the Fourier series is essentially the unique way of representing a function on any part of its domain as a trigonometric series.

\begin{lemma}
  For any sequence $u_n$ and set $E$ of finite measure,
  %
  \[ \lim_{n \to \infty} \int_E \cos^2(nx + u_n)\; dx = |E|/2 \]
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
  We have
  %
  \[ \cos^2(nx + u_n) = \frac{1 + \cos(2nx + 2u_n)}{2} = \frac{1}{2} + \frac{\cos(2nx) \cos(2u_n) - \sin(2nx) \sin(2u_n)}{2} \]
  %
  Since $\cos(2u_n)$ and $\sin(2u_n)$ are bounded, we have $\int \chi_E(x) \cos(2nx)$ and $\int \chi_E(x) \sin(2nx) \to 0$ as $n \to \infty$, and the same is true for the latter component of the sum since $\cos(2u_n)$ and $\sin(2u_n)$ are bounded, we conclude that
  %
  \[ \int_E \cos^2(nx + u_n) = \int \chi_E(x) \cos^2(nx + u_n) = |E|/2 \]
  %
  completing the proof.
\end{proof}

\begin{theorem}[Cantor-Lebesgue Theorem]
  If, for some pair of sequences $a_0, a_1, \dots$ and $b_0, b_1, \dots$ are chosen such that
  %
  \[ \sum_{n = 0}^\infty a_n \cos(2 \pi nx) + b_n \sin(2 \pi nx) \]
  %
  converges on a set of positive measure in $[0,1]$, then $a_n, b_n \to 0$.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
  Let $E$ be the set of points upon which the trigonometric series converges. We write $a_n \cos(2 \pi n x) + b_n \sin(2 \pi n x) = r_n \cos(nx + c_n)$. The result of the theorem is then precisely that $r_n \to 0$. If this is not true, then we must have $\cos(nx + c_n) \to 0$ for every $x \in E$. In particular, the dominated convergence theorem implies that
  %
  \[ \lim_{n \to \infty} \int_E \cos(nx + c_n)^2\; dx = 0 \]
  %
  Yet we know this tends to $|E|/2$ as $n \to \infty$, which is a contradiction.
\end{proof}
