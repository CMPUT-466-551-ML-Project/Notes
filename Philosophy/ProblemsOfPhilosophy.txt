Philosophy, if it cannot *answer* so many questions as we could wish, has at least the power of *asking* questions which increase the interest of the world, and show the strangeness and wonder lying just below the surface even in the commonest things of daily life.

All knowledge, we find, must be built up upon our instinctive beliefs, and if these are rejected, nothing is left. But among our instinctive beliefs some are much stronger than others, while many have, by habit and association, become entangled with other beliefs, not really instinctive, but falsely supposed to be part of what is believed instinctivel. Philosophy should show us the hierarchy of our instinctive beliefs, beginning with those we hold most strongly, and presenting each as much isolated and as free from irrelevant additions as possible. There can never be any reason for rejecting one instinctive belief except that it clashes with others; thus, if they are found to harmonize, the whole system becomes worthy of acceptance.

Most philosophers, rightly or wrongly, believe that philosophy can do much more than this -- that it can give us knowledge, not otherwise attianable, concerning the universe as a whole, and concerning the nature of ultimate reality. Whether this be the case or not, the more modest function we have spoken of can certainly be performed by philosophy, and certainly suffices, for those who have once begun to doubt the adequecy of common sense, to justify the arduous and difficult labours that philosophical problems involve.

Chapter 1: Appearance and Reality

We begin with the following question: Is there any knowledge no 'reasonable' person could doubt? To answer this question, it is natural to begin with what we experience, since some knowledge must be obtained through experience. But if we think critically, we see that almost any knowledge we are predisposed to infer from sensations is incorrect. For instance, in observing a table, it is self evident to us all that the table is brown, rectangular, shiny, smooth, cool, hard to the touch, and makes a distinctive sound when tapped. But all of these facts may be doubted via reason, from which we will come to the conclusion that these properties are not properties of the table itself, but of the *appearance* of the table which we percieve through the senses. Let us argue why this is so:

	- We all agree the table is brown. But if we change the lighting in the room, the precise colour of brown will change. If we fix the lighting, and move around the room, the color of the table will appear to change. The color of the table is also not homogeneous, and so because of the perspective change no two vantage points will give the same distribution of colors which make up the table. A color blind person would not be able to identify that the table is brown, so that without an internal faculty of color-sensing, we would not be able to sense the color of the table. Thus the *exact* shade of brown which makes up the color of the table seems not to be an inherent property of the table, but a property relating to the combination of the table, the lighting of the room it lies in, and the spectator experiencing the color of the table.

	- The table appears smooth to our natural senses, but if we examine the table under a microscope, we see via a finer resolution that the table is jagged and rough. We might then feel like this is the *canonical* texture of the table, though zooming in would reveal the table is made from a discrete arrangement of atoms rather than a continuous structure. Thus the smoothness of the table is not a property of the table, but is a property both of the table, and the type of perception we use to experience the table.

	- The table appears rectangular, but unless we view the table from a birds eye view, the table never *is* rectangular in our vision. We only come to see it as rectangular because we are practiced at reconstructing the shape of the table from the projection of the table onto our retina. Thus the rectangular shape of the table is perceived not just through the appearance of the table, but from our ability to rearranged these appearances into a rectangular form.

	- Pressing on the table shows it is hard, though if we pressed hard enough, the table would crack in half. Similarily, the sound that a table makes when it is tapped on changes depending on how hard we tap the table. Thus the sensation of hardness we experience depends on how hard we press on the table. This goes to show that what we experience of the table is only a potential sign of some property of the table in itself, which causes these sensations. But there is no way to percieve these properties directly.

We conclude from this analysis that the senses do not tell us what is *true* of the table 'in itself', but only what is true about the *appearance* of the table. The table is not immediately known to us, but only inferred from an appearance in our senses. To reason about these things, let us make some definitions of some terms. We call those things *sense data* which are immediately known via sensation, such as colors, sounds, feelings experienced by touch, and so on. *sensation* is the mental process of being immediately aware of sense data.

Our doubt as to our ability to experience a physical object 'in itself' leads to the following questions:	
	
	- Is there a real table at all?
	- Do *physical* objects exist? We call the collection of all physical objects *matter*, so we can rephrase the last question as asking whether matter exists.
	- What constitutes a physical object, and what are the nature of physical objects?

As a preliminary definition of 'matter', let us think of something which is opposed to 'mind', i.e. something which takes up physical space, and is incapable of thought of consciousness. Thus these questions boil down to whether there exists something that is not just a mind, or an idea of the mind. The arguments above show that we can only know physical objects through sense-data, but physical objects cannot be composed of sense-data, because, as we have reasoned above, sense-data cannot be a direct property of physical objects, but is a property depending on a physical object and our faculties of perception.

In the book "Three Dialogues between Hylas and Philonous, in Opposition to Sceptics and Atheists" (1713), Irish bishop George Berkeley (1685-1753) undertook arguments to prove that matter does not exist, since the assumption that matter exists leads to various paradoxes. Thus the world consists solely of minds and their ideas. Some arguments here are more confusing than others, and so does not really prove solidly that matter does not exist. But the main realization is that it is not irrational to believe that matter does not exist, and that if there are things that exist independently of us, we cannot percieve them immediately, but only their appearances through sensation. Berkeley does not deny that there is something else other than our minds and our ideas, but he denies that this other thing is non-mental (if all that existed was in our own minds, things that are not immediately sensed cease to exist, a fact that leads to several confusing consequences we will come to later). Berkeley just doesn't think that thing could be that different from our own mind and it's ideas. Philosophers agreeing with this point are called *idealists*. Berkeley concludes that objects which appear permanent are ideas in the mind of god, who is always vigilant of those objects, and through this vigilance keeps all things in existence. Thus in some sense, Berkeley admits the existence of matter, though this matter is just a family of ideas in the mind of god. Leibnitz (1646-1716), another idealist, argued that what appears as matter to us is a 'colony of souls', perhaps simpler in complexity to the human mind, but a mind nonetheless. Thus, functionally speaking, Leibnitz also admits the existence of matter as a certain subfamily of ideas in another's mind.





Chapter 2: The Existence of Matter

In this chapter we try and elaborate on the problem of the existence of matter. In particular, we confront the idea of whether these is anything independant of our mind at all. Our main conclusion is that though we will not be able to strictly prove that everything does not emerge from the mind, there is no reason to suppose that it does.

The one thing we can start our discussions with certainty about is that we do experience sensation. It is the cause of sensation that can be doubted. To determine what else is certain, we try and use the system of *systemic doubt* as developed by Rene Descartes (1596-1650), who decided that in his philosophical investigations, he would only believe something unless it was true clearly and distinctly. Anything he could reasonably doubt, he would doubt. In his investigations of this method, he came to the conclusion that the only existence he could be certain of was his own existence. For instance, it is possible, though perhaps improbable, that there is a demon could give us any arrangement of sense-data to convince of a logically consistent outer reality without any such reality existing, so it is reasonable to doubt the existence of this reality. But Descartes existence and the existence of his experience, could not be doubted, for otherwise he could not be decieved in his own senses. This is the famous 'Cogito Ergo Sum' argument, which Descartes thought provided a solid base to begin the pursuit of knowledge.

The problem is that we cannot be sure of anything outside of the fact that we exist at the current moment, and experience things at this moment. Anything else can be doubted. For instance, we might be certain we exist, but we cannot be certain that we 'existed'. It is possible that the universe sprang into existence five miliseconds, with all signs of the past, including our memories, created at that instant. So we cannot even be certain that we existed in the past. When we have experience of sensations that common sense attributes to a table, it is possible that we are being tricked by a demon. But if we believe that there is nothing that exists apart from sense data, we arrive at certain paradoxical conclusions. If a table only exists by virtue of our sensation, this means that when we close our eyes, the table ceases to exist. Of course, Descartes method tells us this is possible. We must not necessarily be frightened by conclusions that defy common sense. Indeed, in some sense this experience is possible even in the realm of common sense, since we can dream of objects that have no physical reality, and we do not realise this until we wake up from that dream (but we note that we do not deny the existence of the *sense-data* that composes the dream, just the cause of that sense-data, i.e. when we see a ghost, we do not doubt the existence of the sense-data of the ghost, but we deny the existence of a physical 'ghost' which causes us to sense a ghost).

So it is logically possible to believe that all that exists is our mind and it's ideas. But there is no *reason* to believe this is the case, and it leads to a less simple explanation for sensations, for reasons we now detail:
	
	- One utility of the existence of physical matter is that it provides us with a family of public 'neutral' objects that all other minds can collectively percieve. Sense-data is completely private to each individual. You might tell someone about your sense data, but they obtain their own separate sense-data from the sensation of hearing you talk about your sense data. If no object existed apart from sense-data, no collectively shared experience could be possible. However, while this makes physical matter of functional utility, we cannot necessarily appeal to the testimony of other's sense-data in an argument about the existence, because to do so would imply we have some way of being certain of another mind's private sense-data. We cannot access another mind's sense-data, only their testimony of that sense data, which forms our own sense-data, so this argument is not completely convincing.

	- On the other hand, it does seem that our sensations are a relation between the faculty of our mind's perception, and physical objects. Thus if physical objects do not exist independently of our mind, we cannot ever obtain evidence about the existence of other independant minds from our own, since we infer the existence of other minds from their bodies. Thus we can only know of the existence of other minds if physical matter exists.

	- If we doubt the existence of things other than our mind, sensation, and ideas, then we require a very complex theory of how the objects in our mind change over time. If a cat moves from one side of the room to the other while our eyes are closed, then, assuming external existence, we can explain this phenomenon by stating that the cat was in a family of intermediate positions across the room while our eyes are closed. But if we only believe in the mind, sensation, and our ideas, then we must agree that the cat has teleported from one side of the room to the other (it did not exist while our eyes were closed), and it is difficult to obtain an explanation of this fact. If we go to work, our cat no longer exists, so it appears complicated to explain how, when we return from work and the cat exists again, it has become hungry. An explanation for this behaviour seems incomprehensible unless we assume the existence of something independent to our mind.

	- When we hear humans speak, it is very difficult to imagine that what we are percieving is not the output of another mind. A similar phenomenon can occur in dreams, but dreams seem to reflect the ideas we sense in our everyday life before we dream.

	- Dreams can be accounted for in physical theories, which means that we can predict that some experiences do not correspond to physical objects.

Ultimately, belief in things external to the mind is instinctual. The discovery that we cannot perceive objects independantly of our mind does not contradict this belief. No paradoxes seem to emerge either. On the other hand, it seems to simplify the way we see the world. Thus we should belief in things external to the mind. This is a general strategy behind many epistemological arguments, that cannot be argued as strongly as mathematical proofs. All knowledge is built upon instincts, and if we reject all instincts, no knowledge is left. It is possible that these instincts may be false, but through *reason* we cannot reject a belief unless it contradicts another, more strongly held belief. Once we have elaborated the relations between the beliefs, we should accept those that are most possible, or most simple. Is is then possible that we may as a result believe something that is not true, but the likelihood of this diminishes as we continue to elaborate the relation between our beliefs and other beliefs, and form systemic knowledge that is true in relation to each of its parts.

The goal of philosophy is to perform the process of clarifying, relating, and systemizing instinctual beliefs, and to show that those we should believe do not clash, but rather harmonize with one another. Other philosophers believe a stronger goal, i.e. that philosophy can be used to achieve certain knowledge about the fundamental nature of reality and the universe. We might doubt this goal, but it certainly seems possible to accomplish the more modest goal, which is still important enough to justify the study of philosophy.





Chapter 3: The Nature of Matter

In the previous chapter, we came to the conclusion that we should believe that our sense data corresponds to something external to ourselves. There is something else which causes the appearances we obtain through sensation. So now we ask, what are the properties of that other thing?

Modern science has come to the view that the fundamental properties of physical matter are *motion* through space and time. Science does not deny that physical matter may have other properties, but at this moment, these appear to be the only properties of physical matter which explain our sensations of physical matter. We re-emphasize that these properties of physical matter cannot be directly accessed by our senses. This can lead to some confusion:
	
	- When we say light is a wave, we must distinguish the sensation of light that we experience, from the physical object, which is a wave, and causes the sensation of light. A man who was completely blind could probably never come to terms with the sensation that comes from experiencing light, but could come to an understanding of the theoretical physical wave that causes the sensation of light.

	- We should be very careful in our definition of motion through space and time, because, while it is essential that matter lies in space, because the motion of objects happens through space, but the space that we infer from our senses and intuitions is *not* the space that these objects lie in, which is independent of our senses. We might expect our internal notion of space to correspond to external features of space, but this is not necessary, and these two notions of space are not identical.

	- The distinction between internal and external time is perhaps more intuitive. We can percieve some events as shorter or longer depending on whether we are excited or bored, though external time is independent of our emotions. Nonetheless, it seems that internal and external time both agree on the relations between two events, i.e. whether events happened before or after. We must be slightly careful on this point, when we see lightning, and then hear thunder, we are still allowed to think of the physical causes of these sensations as happening at the same time; it is the event of percieving these events which happens before and after one another. Similarily, if the sun were to go out, we would not experience the effects of this happening until eight minutes after this event. This is a reminder that our internal notion of time can only directly percieve when sense-data was obtained, and cannot percieve external time.

If our sensations to be causes by physical objects, then our senses must be percieved through physical objects, *sensory organs*, so we can parameterize the way our perceptions change as the location of our sensory organs changes, e.g. we do not see an object when it goes behind another object from the physical location of our eyes. We feel an object when our fingers come suitably close to that object, and so on. We can only know the relations between the properties of physical objects that cause our sensations to appear.

It remains to ask if there is anything else we can know about the intrinsic nature of physical objects. The common sense hypothesis is that the intrinsic nature of physical objects, though certainly not identifiable with our mental picture of space and time, agree as like as is possible. As we have seen previously, we still have no basis for assuming that objects have an intrinsic color that agrees with what we see, since we have argued that this color changes depending on how we see the object.






Chapter 4: Idealism

Different philosophers view idealism slightly differently. For our purposes, by idealism we mean the belief that whatever exists must be mental. Despite that common sense tells us this is obviously absurd, this belief is widely held by philosophers (at least in the 1920s). And we have seen that this belief is not entirely groundless, because we can never directly percieve physical objects in themselves, so whatever properties these physical objects have must be absurd.

The normal arguments upon which idealism is advocated is that there are certain conditions which are required for us to know things, and these conditions necessitate idealism. Let us start with Berkeley's approach. He defines an *idea* to be anything which is known immediately. For instance, colors we see or voices we hear are ideas, but also memories or imaginations. Anything we know externally to us consists of ideas. Anything that is possible to know must therefore be 'in the mind', and so there are no grounds for supposing that there is anything else that is real but ideas, whether our own, or of another individual. A tree continues to exist when no individual sees it because God percieves it for us. The tree continues to exist as long as God continues to percieve it. The main problem in Russell's mind with this argument is a confusion between sensation and sense-data. Undoubtably, both sensation and sense-data occur in the mind. But a sensation is caused *by something*, and it is not necessarily true that this cause is a mental object.

Another, very similar argument starts with what appears to be a self-evident proposition, that we cannot know any thing exists unless we know it in itself, and thus anything that is relevant to our experience must be possible to be known, and thus be mental. This is a more difficult argument to refute, and we will come back to it in time.

Come back to the last page or two later on - I didn't understand it.








Chapter 5: Knowledge by Acquaintance vs Knowledge by Description

In the previous chapters, we have found that we should distinguish between two types of knowledge. The first, knowledge *of things*, and the second, knowledge *of truths*, often called judgements. Knowledge of a thing through direct awareness, without any inference of knowledge of truths, we shall call *an acquaintance*, so that we have certain *knowledge by acquaintance*. Thus we have direct acquaintance with sense-data. Knowledge by acquaintance is more simple than any knowledge of truths, and logically independent. Once we see a particular shade of color, we know that sense-data utterly and completely.

To contrast knowledge of objects via acquaintance, we cannot be acquainted with physical objects. We only have knowledge of these objects through the sense-data which we believed are caused, in part, by these ogtsucak objects. Because knowledge of physical objects can only be inferred from judgements, this makes knowledge of these objects a degree more complicated than objects known through acquaintance. We therefore know of the table via *knowledge by description*, i.e. we connect a unique object via judgements to what we are acquainted with, judgements such as the statement "This particular chair is the cause of the color I am acquainted with".  Question: Without the notion of cause and effect, is there no way of knowing the outside world?

There must be other things we are acquainted with than sense-data, for otherwise we could not know very much at all:

	- Once we no longer have sense-data, we are no longer acquainted with the sense data. We are instead acquainted with the *memory* of hte sense data. Thus memories provide another family of objects to which we are acquainted. Memory is necessary for knowledge of the past, for without an acquaintance with memory we would never even know a past existed.

	- We are acquainted with the mental experience of awareness, i.e. we have an acquaintance with *introspection*. When I see the sun, I am also aquainted with the mental process of seeing the sun. We are also aware of other mental processes, like our feelings of pleasure, pain, and other emotions. We call this ability to introspect *self consciousness*.

	It is important, however, to note that we are not really conscious of *ourself*, but consciousness of thoughts, feelings, and desires, rather than consciousness of the "I". The question of whether we are acquainted with ourselves is a more difficult question, which should be disentangled from acquaintance with thoughts and feelings.

	Acquaintance with the mental act of perception is really an acquaintance with a *relation*, i.e. a relation between sense-data, and the perciever. It is a strange judgement, that we can be acquainted with this relation, and not be directly acquainted with one of the objects in the relation, i.e. the I which acts as the perciever in this situation. But there are arguments for and against acquaintance with ourself.

	- In order to be able to make judgements, we need other acquaintance with another family of objects, called *abstract ideas*, or *universals*. Every sentence in the English language contains a universal, since all verbs have universal meaning. We return to this notion later. Thus not everything that we are acquainted with is a particular, existential object.

Let us now focus on knowledge by description. A *description* is any phrase of the form *a BLAH* (an *ambiguous* description) or *the BLAH* (a *definite* description). An object is *known by description* when we know that it is the only object with a certain property. It is generally implied that if an object is known by description, it is not known by acquaintance, i.e. we have *merely descriptive knowledge* of that object. Knowledge by description of our chief importance, for it enables us to pass beyond the limits of our private experience and gain knowledge about the world around us.

When we say "The BLAH exists", we are saying there is a single object which satisfies the property described by BLAH, and no other object also satisfies this proeprty. Common words are usually descriptions in disguise. Let us suppose we make some statement about Otto von Bismarck. Provided we can be acquainted with the "I", Bismarck himself may have this statement to designate the individual who he was directly acquainted with. Thus the name fits the use it wishes to have, i.e. a description that refers to an existing object. But any other individual uses the name in a different way, in describing an object they have heard other people call that name through their ears. That person was acquainted with sense data, which was inferred to be caused by Bismarck's mind and body, and a description was formed in the mind as to the body and mind that causes this sense data. It is an important point that any applicable description must be connected to something that we are acquainted with, e.g. "the past" is an object that is only applicable in relation to our memory, "the present" in relation to our sense-data, if we are to obtain any information about the object that description refers to except that which follows logically from the description. On the other hand, logical matters need not be concerned with descriptions that refer to particular objects.

QUESTION: What acquaintances "the future" connect to?

Question: How does Bayesian reasoning `correctly quantify' induction?







Chapter 6: On Induction

We now know that we know that what we are acquainted with exists, and that what we once knew existed in the past. Objects we are acquainted with gives us our *data*. If we are to draw inferences from this data, we must have some general principles that allow us to do so, i.e. rules that enable us, from the existence of one object A, to infer the existence of some other object B. Without these principles, we would never be able to know anything beyond what we are acquainted with.

We are all convinced that the sun will tomorrow. But why is this a reasonable belief? The natural answer is "because it has risen every other day in the past". We might also reference certain physical laws of motion, i.e. that objects continue to rotate unless there is some outside interference. Though we might doubt our ability to know no intereference has taken place, but we do not dwell on this doubt, the interesting question is whether it is legitimate to doubt our knowledge that physical laws remain the same day after day.

Experience has shown that the repetition of some act *causes* us to believe it will happen in the future. Despite that these beliefs can be misleading (a chicken who is fed every day by a man is eventually strangled by that man) they certianly exist. Thus we have an instinct for this belief. But this is not necessarily grounds to determine if such acts are reasonable.

Thus we must investigate that validity of the principle of "the uniformity of nature", the belief that everything that has happened, or will happen, is an instance of some general law. General rules that appear to have exceptions are really replaced by more general rules that account for these exceptions. The business of science is to find these correct uniformities about the physical world.

One argument that the future is like the past is that the future eventually becomes the past, so that the past is really just an experience of what was once the future. But there are problems with this argument. At the present moment, we only have experience of these *past futures*, and not the *future futures*. So the argument that future futures resemble past futures is not resolved. The problem of the uniformity of nature does not necessarily necessite a discussion of the future, because there are events in the present that we have no sense data of immediately.

To be more precise, when we use these arguments are apply the principle of induction. The first way of stating a version of the principle is that, if objects of type A have, in the past, always been associated with objects of type B, then it is reasonable to believe that, given an object of type A, there will be an associated type B. The more often we have seen this association, the more reasonable this belief is. Another version of the principle is that it is then more reasonable to believe in the *general law* of association, rather than a belief in a particular instantiation of the law.

We cannot use experience to disprove the principle of induction. Nor can we use experience to prove the principle of induction, because the induction principle only gives us knowledge about objects which have not yet been examined, and so we cannot know anything else about. But, because all of our knowledge of the future, or the unknown, rests on this principle, it is very difficult to deny. The existence and applicability of such beliefs are the most difficult and debated topics in philosophy.

Question: How do we quantify this via Bayesian probability, and justify this?














Meeting Notes 1:
	- Does the consequence of the Schr\"{o}dinger's Cat thought experiment show that Schr\"{o}dinger was an idealist? Is the many worlds interpretation of quantum physics idealist?

	- I can't comprehend how external space can be different from internal space. Does science necessitate external space, or just that physical matter exists, and we can comprehend it's properties as an internal space?
