Fractals Avoiding Fractal Configurations

What's the largest Hausdorff dimension a Euclidean set can have avoiding configurations? How large can a set of real numbers be avoiding arithmetic progressions, or subsets of the plane not containing vertices of equilateral triangles? Modern harmonic analysis has found that stability results for many analytical operations reduces to the existence or nonexistence of such sets. General methods have been developed to find sets avoiding `smoothly specifiable configurations'. Recently, we've been able to extend these methods to `fractally specified configurations'. Applying this method, for instance, gives high dimensional sets whose difference set avoid rational translates of the Cantor set. We introduce a novel application of randomized configuration avoidance method combined with the configuration discretization method standard in the field to obtain the required result.
