\part{Linear Partial Differential Equations}

Here we study the techniques of the \emph{constant coefficient} linear partial differential equations
%
\[ Lf(x) = \sum a_\alpha D^\alpha f(x) \]
%
and the \emph{non constant coefficient} partial differential equations
%
\[ Lf(x) = \sum a_\alpha(x) D^\alpha f(x) \]
%
The central problems of the theory are \emph{existence} and \emph{regularity}: Given $f$, does a solution $u$ to the equation $Lu = f$ exist, and if so, how does the regularity of $f$ relate to the regularity of $u$. We often phrase the regularity problems in terms of function spaces. Let $\{ X^s \}$ be a family of function spaces, indexed by a parameter $s \in \RR$, measuring the \emph{regularity} of functions in these spaces. Given a linear partial differential operator $L$, a regularity result might say that for some $s$ and $t$, if $Lu = f$, where $f \in X^s$, then $u$ in $X^t$. Such results often require one to use the special properties of the operator $L$; general theories are rarely available, except for certain very special families of partial differential equations, especially the \emph{elliptic partial differential equations}.

\chapter{Elliptic Equations}

Consider a partial differential operator $L f(x) = \sum a_\alpha(x) D^\alpha f(x)$, where $a_\alpha \in C^\infty(\RR^n)$. Associated with this operator is it's symbol $a(x,\xi) = \sum a_\alpha(x) \xi^\alpha$, and if $L$ has order $m$, it's principle symbol is $a_m(x,\xi) = \sum_{|\alpha| = m} a_\alpha(x) \xi^\alpha$. We say $L$ is \emph{elliptic} near $x_0$ if $a_m(x_0,\xi) = 0$ only when $\xi = 0$. This is equivalent to assuming that there exists $M > 0$, and two constants $c_1$ and $c_2$ and a small neighborhood $U$ of $x_0$ such that $c_1 |\xi|^m \leq |a(x,\xi)| \leq c_2 |\xi|^m$ for $|\xi| \geq M$.

Elliptic operators have a near complete theory, because they are \emph{invertible} modulo smoothing operators. More precisely
