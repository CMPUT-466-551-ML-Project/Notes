Slide 0

- Thanks everyone for coming to the talk, and thanks to the organizers
	for organizing this conference. I'm sure it's not easy to replan given the quarantine, and I very much appreciate the oportunity to talk about my research today.

- Going to talk about some work on pattern avoidance
	I've been working on with my advisors over the past couple years.

=============
Slide 1
=============

- From a very general perspective, my research is related to the phenomenon
 	that structure appears in objects with large cardinality.

- In combinatorics this would be called Ramsey theory. But the problems I want to consider require a more analytical foundation than those in Ramsey theory, for example, using techniques in Geometric Measure Theory / Harmonic Analysis.

=============
Slide 2
=============

- Here are two examples of the problems we consider.

- Is it true that a `large enough' set must contain three points that form a right angle?

- Alternatively, if a subgroup of the real line is large enough, does it necessarily contain a rational number?

- But `largeness' isn't well defined concept; We can find infinite discrete sets not containing right angles. But also every set with positive Lebesgue measure must contain three points forming a right angle.

- So neither Lebesgue measure nor cardinality is a good measure of largeness on these types of problems. What other measures of largeness can we use?

=============
Slide 3
=============

- It turns out that for these problems, the most effective quantification of largeness is to use a fractal dimension, which measures the `thickness' of a set in R^d (thin sets have dimension zero, acting like finite collections of points, and thick sets have dimension d, acting like a set of positive Lebesgue measure).

- Notice that in the following examples, the exponent in N in the covering number reveals the dimension of the given object.

- In general, we say a set has Minkowski dimension s if it takes N^s cubes of sidelength 1/N to cover X, up to a multiplicative constant. If it takes many cubes to cover a set, it is thick, and thus has a high Minkowsk dimension.

- There is a closely related concept known as the Hausdorff dimension. Treat this as the same as Minkowski dimension if you aren't familiar with these concepts. It's almost the same for any compact set that comes up.

- So now our question is, does a `pattern' occur in a set which is particularly large, i.e. if the set has large enough dimension. My research focuses on the opposite problem, constructing sets with large dimension which do `not' contain a particular pattern.

=============
Slide 4
=============

- A general way to formulate these types of problems is by consolidating all instances of a particular pattern into a single set Z, and then constructing a set X which avoids Z.

- For instance, if we want to discuss the problem of finding a set that avoids right angles, we can let Z be the set of all triples of points that form a right angle. Then X avoids Z if and only if it doesn't contain right angles.

- One advantage of this viewpoint is that we can ask what geometric information about Z we can exploit to produce high dimensional sets avoiding Z.

- For instance, in the right angled triangle example, Z is a degree two algebraic hypersurface in (R^d)^3, which could be handy information.

=============
Slide 5
=============

- There are several authors that have considered this formulation previously.

- In 2012, Andras Mathe found a method which shows we can avoid sets Z effectively if they are low degree hypersurfaces.

- In 2016, Rob Fraser and Malabika Pramanik showed that if Z has low codimension, and n is small, then we can effectively avoid Z.

- Notice that Mathe is able to give a result independant of the quantity n, which is the number of points in a given pattern (for instance, 3 for right angles). But Mathe has to work with a very rigid object in order to obtain this result.

- My research is trying to obtain a result depending on less rigid geometric information than Mathe, Fraser, and Pramanik. For instance, the Minkowski dimension of Z is defined for most intreresting sets, and thus isn't as rigid as codimension or degree. And if Z is a `thin set', it should be intuitively easy to avoid?

=============
Slide 6
=============

- So in 2019 we published a method that showed that, yes, if Z is a thin set, then one can effectively avoid Z with a set with large dimension.

- Notice that, like with Fraser and Pramanik's result, our result does depend on the value n, and thus is not effective when the number of points in a pattern is large (like avoiding regular dodecahedrons).

- However, I have found a partial result suggesting that, if we can project Z down to a thin set in a lower dimension space, we can avoid Z effectively independant of n.

- This only give a one dimensional, i.e. when d = 1. I want to find an interesting higher dimensional generalization of this before I publish this result, but this case is proved in my master's thesis.

=============
Slide 7
=============

- Let us consider two applications of these results. The first is a `complementary subgroup' problem. But rather than considering this problem algebraically, let's consider whether we can `complement' a subgroup analytically, i.e. finding a disjoint subgroup with complementary fractal dimension. Our result implies this is possible on the real line.

- The only way a set X can generate a group which contains elements of H is if their exists elements x1, ..., xn in X and integers m1, ..., mn such that m1x1 + ... + mnxn is an element of H. So for each m, we can consider this set containing the patterns of this kind we want to avoid.

- Note that the projection of the set Z has dimension s, so we can apply the projection result we obtained to find a set with dimension 1-s.

- We would hope that whatever higher dimensional variant of the result given before, it should be able to find complementary subgroups in higher dimensions as well.

=============
Slide 8
=============

- Our second application I want to give shows that our method can deal with quite exotic situations as compared to previous results in the literature because of the non-rigid geometric information we exploit. In particular, we can construct `subsets of fractals' avoiding patterns, rather than just general subsets of Euclidean space avoiding patterns.

- To begin, we note that there are some fractals that can be projected surjectively onto open subsets of Euclidean space. For instance, the Cantor dust (which is a two-dimensional variant of the Cantor set) can be projected at a 45 degree angle onto an interval on the real line.

- A pattern on the Cantor dust can be projected onto a pattern on the interval. If we then solve the problem on the interval, we can then project our solution back up, which is possible because we don't assume rigid geometric constraints on the pattern.

- Let us try and avoid right angles on the Cantor dust. We let Z be the family of triples of points on a line which project back up onto points on the Cantor dust that form a right angle.

- Basic considerations suggest that Z should have Minkowski dimension two. If we return to our original calculations, this gives a subset of the line with dimension 1/2. Projecting back up gives a set with dimension at least 1/2 avoiding right angles.

- In a paper with Malabika Pramanik and Josh Zahl, we used this method to find subsets of Lipschitz curves with avoid isosceles triangles.

=============
Slide 9
=============

- I wanted to end this talk by showing some research in progress.

- Minkowski dimension is one way to measure the `thickness' of sets, but there are multiple other measurements of thickness. One that we still have many open questions about is the Fourier dimension.

- A set has large Fourier dimension `is thick' if it's Fourier transform decays fast at infinity.

- Intuitively, the Fourier transform of a measure tells you how correlated the mass of a measure is with a wave travelling at a particular frequency. If your measure corresponds to a smooth function, then a fast enough wave cannot be correlated with your measure, so the Fourier transform must decay fast at infinity. However, if your measure is concetrated at a few points, we can find arbitrarily fast oscillating waves that are correlated with this measure, so the Fourier transform doesn't decay at all at infinity. Interpolating in between with our imagination shows intermediate sets should have some intermediate notion of decay.

- Often, the Fourier dimension is more powerful at determining patterns than Hausdorff dimension.

- For instance, we know that there are sets with Hausdorff dimension one which do not contain any solutions to linear equations of arbitrary length. However, Walter Rudin showed a set with positive Fourier dimension must contain solutions to some linear equation.

=============
Slide 10
=============

- The Fourier dimension is always the smallest dimension out of those mentioned in the talk. With current tools it is often very difficult to find sets with high Fourier dimension avoiding sets. If you take a `generic' set, you will find that all the dimensions agree with one another, but for most particular examples of fractals, the Fourier dimension is zero.

- For instance, the Cantor set has Hausdorff dimension equal to log_3(2), but the Fourier dimension is equal to zero. The Fourier transform of any finite measure supported on the Cantor set cannot decay at infinity.

- A useful heuristic is that some amount of `square root cancellation' has to occur in your construction of a fractal if you want the Fourier dimension to agree with the Hausdorff dimension. For instance, if you randomly translate each interval in the construction to the right and left by a small number, the Cantor set becomes Salem.

=============
Slide 11
=============

- In the past few months I have been working on try to use our methods to construct sets with a large Fourier dimension by employing randomness. I've yet to publish this result, but I have been able to prove that, given only the assumptions previously stated on the Minkowski dimension of the avoiding set Z, we can find a set with a particular Fourier dimension. This was not possible using previous methods, i.e. Pramanik/Fraser and Mathe (they do structured things which destroy the Fourier dimension, so their sets have Fourier dimension zero).

- The reason we are not able to obtain precisely our previous result is that we have to do one deterministic `deletion step' in our construction.

- I conjecture that if Z is a `suitably smooth' configuration, in a sense I have yet to precisely define, than we can recover the bounds of our previous result completely using only Fourier dimension.
