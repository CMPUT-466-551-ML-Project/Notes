Philosophy, if it cannot *answer* so many questions as we could wish, has at least the power of *asking* questions which increase the interest of the world, and show the strangeness and wonder lying just below the surface even in the commonest things of daily life.

All knowledge, we find, must be built up upon our instinctive beliefs, and if these are rejected, nothing is left. But among our instinctive beliefs some are much stronger than others, while many have, by habit and association, become entangled with other beliefs, not really instinctive, but falsely supposed to be part of what is believed instinctivel. Philosophy should show us the hierarchy of our instinctive beliefs, beginning with those we hold most strongly, and presenting each as much isolated and as free from irrelevant additions as possible. There can never be any reason for rejecting one instinctive belief except that it clashes with others; thus, if they are found to harmonize, the whole system becomes worthy of acceptance.

Most philosophers, rightly or wrongly, believe that philosophy can do much more than this -- that it can give us knowledge, not otherwise attianable, concerning the universe as a whole, and concerning the nature of ultimate reality. Whether this be the case or not, the more modest function we have spoken of can certainly be performed by philosophy, and certainly suffices, for those who have once begun to doubt the adequecy of common sense, to justify the arduous and difficult labours that philosophical problems involve.




Chapter 1: Appearance and Reality

Is there are knowledge that no person following the faculties of reason could doubt?

- It is natural to begin with what we experience, since we obtain knowledge through our experience.
	- The knowledge we are naturally predisposed to infer from sensations is incorrect.
		- This table is brown, oblong, shiny to the eye, smooth, cool, and hard to the touch. It has a distinct sound when tapped. Everyone will agree with this. But no two people will see the exact same distribution of colors that makeup the brown, shiny table unless they are in exactly the same location. Different lighting will change the color of the table. A color blind person will not be able to identify that the table is brown. The `exact' shade of brown of the table therefore seems not to be an inherent property of the table, but a property relating to the table, the lighting, and the spectator experiencing the color of the table.

		- The table is smooth, but if we looked under a microscope, we would see that the table is jagged and rough. Which of these is the `correct' property of the table. We might be predisposed to say the microscopic view is correct, though zooming in we would imagine that atoms would appear. Thus the smoothness of the table depends on what is used to experience the table.

		- The table is rectangular, though we never see the rectangular shape purely through vision. It is not actually rectangular from any point of view, but we are practiced in reconstructing the shape from the projection of the table onto our retina.

		- Pressing on the table shows it is hard, but the sensation we experience depends on how hard we press on the table. Thus what we experience of the table is only a sign of some property that perhaps causes these sensations, but we do not percieve these properties directly. The sound of the table is similar.

	- Conclusion: The senses do not tell us what is `true' about the table, but only tell us what is `true' about the *appearance* of the table. The table is not *immediately* known to us, but only inferred by how that table appears to us.

Two natural questions:
	1) Is there a real table at all? More generally, do *physical objects* exist? We shall call the collection of all physical objects *matter*.
	2) If so, what kind of object is it? What are the nature of physical objects?

- We cannot know the table at all without sense-data. But the table is not itself composed of sense-data, and the sense-data are not even direct properties of the table, because they depend on our faculties of perception. The relation of sense-data to the table is therefore more complex than we first realized.

- How do we define matter? Something that occupies space, and is incapable of thought or consciousness.

- Bishop Berkeley (1685-1753): In "Three Dialogues Between Hylas and Philonous, in Opposition to Sceptics and Aetheists", Berkeley argues that matter does not exist, and that only minds and ideas exist, showing that paradoxes exist if matter is assumed. Berkeley may not prove matter does not exist, but he does show that it is logically possible to deny the existence of matter, and that if there are things that exist independent of our mind, they cannot be pure sense-data. Berkeley does not deny that sense-data shows there is something that is independent of us, but he denies that this other thing is non-mental (otherwise things that are not sensed would cease to exist, which seems odd given the reproducibility of sense-data). This other thing could not be that different from our own perception, and thus the permenant thing that exists is an idea in the mind of God, which is vigilant of all permenant things, and keeps all such things in existence. Other idealists who do not accept god see that things exist in the collective mind of the universe (by idealist, we mean a philosopher who does not believe in the existence of matter). Leibnitz (1646-1716) is an idealist, arguing that what appears as matter is just a collection of minds, perhaps simpler than the human mind.

- It seems that almost all philosophers agree that there does exist something independent of ourselves, despite the fact that sense-data depends on us. But because we can only perceive sense-data, which depends on us, does this mean that we cannot really know about reality at all (even it's existence?)


Chapter 2: The Existence of Matter

- If we cannot be sure of the existence of matter, we cannot be sure that other minds exist, since we only percieve other minds through their interactions with matter. We want physical objects to exist causing sense-data so that other people percieve the same object, rather than percieving their own sense-data.

Note: Denying the existence of matter does not mean we deny the existence of sense-data, we just doubt what causes this sense data. When we dream of a ghost, we are not denying the existence of the sense-data of the ghost, just denying the physical object of a ghost which causes us to sense a ghost.

Descartes (1596-1650): Invented the method of systemic doubt. Descartes decided he would only believe something unless it was true clearly and distinctly. Anything he could reasonably doubt, he would doubt.

- A Demon could present sense-data to convince us of the existence of reality. This is possible, though perhaps improbable, but by Descartes method should still be doubted. Thus it is logically reasonable to doubt the existence of matter.

- Only thing we can be convinced about: We exist, because otherwise we could not be decieved by the demon. Cogito Ergo Sum.
	- Some complications: I certainly exist, but how long have I existed? A demon could have created me 1 instant ago, and implanted false memories in my head.

- What reasons do we have to believe that physical objects exist?
	- People perceive similar (though not exactly the same) things as one another. There are laws of perspective and laws of reflection that determine why different people percieve different sense data of objects.
		- Nonetheless, the existence of matter cannot be argued because of the testimony of other people, because that testimony is also sense-data (the existence of that person assumes to some extent physical matter).

	- Although the non-existence of matter is possible, it is not necessarily true.

	- The existence of matter seems a simpler hypothesis than the non-existence of matter, and requires less accounting.
		- A cat moves across a room. We look at it while it is at one side, and look at it again when it has reached the other side. If physical objects do not exist, we would have to say that the cat teleported, since it does not make sense for the cat to have been inbetween these two points, since we did not sense this.
		- A cat gets hungry. If the cat does not exist unless we see it, how did it get hungry after a certain period of time? And a cat cannot hungry, because hunger is a concept percieved only through my own sense data.
		- The natural behaviour of the cat seems incomprehensible unless we assume the existence of matter.

		- There is no good reason to reject the belief in the physical reality.

	- Dreams can be accounted for in physical theories, which means that we can predict that some experiences do not correspond to physical objects.

	- Belief in physical objects is an instinct.
		- All knowledge is built upon our instinctive beliefs, and if we reject all instinct, there is nothing left.
		- There are no grounds to reject a belief except on the grounds of another belief. 
		- The goal of philosophy is to clarify and relate instinctual beliefs, and to show they do not clash, but harmonize with one another. By organizing our beliefs and their consequences, we systematically order our knowledge with less error than we did beforehand. This modest goal is achievable by philosophy (though)
