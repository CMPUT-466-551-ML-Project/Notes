J.P. Kahane. Probabilities and Baireâ€™s theory in harmonic anal-
ysis. 2000.

	(May 2020): I found a survey on the application of the probabilistic 
	method and the Baire category theorem in Harmonic analysis [7]. I feel
	this method is very exploitable in the types of problems I cur-
	rently deal with, so if only for culture, this should be a useful
