What's the largest set avoiding a given configuration on Euclidean space? In this talk, we discuss recent work constructing sets with large Hausdorff dimension avoiding configurations. Examples include constructing a subset of the line avoiding arithmetic progressions, or constructing a set whose difference set avoids all rational translates of the Cantor set. Modern analysis has found that the stability of analytical operations reduces to the existence or inexistence of large fractal sets with irregularity properties, whose size is quantified by Hausdorff dimension. Most famously, in 1971 Fefferman reduced the boundedness of certain Fourier operators to the solution of the Kakeya conjecture. These configurations are therefore of interest to Harmonic analysts, Ergodic theorists, and anyone who studies operators on Euclidean space. I give a general introduction to the field, as well as a discussion of the recent work we've done on certain classes of configurations.
